pumpkin large: $2.59

pumpkin extra large: $2.79

it's an absurd price difference. surely the sweetener is more expensive than the coffee?",how come the pumpkin coffee is less expensive than black coffee?
1,DunkinDonuts,"a few weeks ago someone posted a comment about changing the zip code in the app to 90001 to get in early on the new rewards program (which sucks) and getting a free medium coffee by doing so. well, i did it and now i cannot change it back to my actual zip code, 2838 miles to the east. not only have i not been able to get the free medium coffee but any of the reward offers ive selected are redeemable in california only. ive tried deleting and re-installing app &amp; accessing account on-line to change it but the zip code field is locked. i will email their customer support but i figured i would as here first. thanks",dunkin app zip code issue
2,DunkinDonuts,"our nearest dunkin is a bit of a drive, and the flavorings available to buy in the stores are garbage.   would like to be able to replicate their hazelnut flavored iced coffee at home when we can't get to dunkin.",can you buy the unsweetened flavors dunkin uses?
3,DunkinDonuts,"how do i ask for an extra shot of flavor in the mobile app? i get medium coconut iced, 2 creams (or, large with 4 creams depending on how dead i am lol)… you can ask for less flavor shots but not more. am i missing something? i keep meaning to ask when i go in to pick up my order, but it’s always so crazy and i don’t have time before work to stand on line and wait to ask. tia!",mobile app ordering question

7,DunkinDonuts,and for all the entitled jerks who are mad they can't use apple pay at the drive thru you can add apple pay as the payment option in the dunkin app.. that way you can still be the cool cat  and impress your bougie friends in the car. and you can leave your shoes off while you do it,apple pay at dt
8,DunkinDonuts,"i was at a local dunkin at the beginning of the month @ saw a sign that said on september 1st, teachers can get a free coffee. i want to say it was a small or medium hot or iced. i haven’t been back that way recently to look at it again, but also haven’t seen any other local dunkin advertising this promo. does anyone know anything about this? for context, i’m in upstate (central) ny. thanks!",9/1 promo
9,DunkinDonuts,"this is probably a strange question, but do workers assemble the breakfast sandwiches themselves or do they come frozen and pre-made? our usual dunkin has been closed for the last three months for remodeling and we’ve been going to a different one. about once a week, we get breakfast from there and the sandwiches seem so different at the other location. ours just opened back a few days ago and it got me wondering about the sandwiches.",do workers make the sandwiches?

17,DunkinDonuts,so it seems dunkin pulled a fast one and put the pumpkin spice in the cold foam instead of the drink itself. how would you fix the cold foam on the app to actually have pumpkin? no wonder they're offering it for $3 till november.,how would you fix the pumpkin spice cold foam?
18,DunkinDonuts,"how much is extra cream cheese? it’s not an option on the app to to get extra but recently  i’ve been getting the garden veggie and i usually want a little extra. the first few times they would just throw an extra in the bag, but recently a worker said it cost money, 1.75. then the next day another worker said it was 1.80? does anyone know the answer??",extra cream cheese?
19,DunkinDonuts,"i can't drink regular milk or cream as i am lactose intolerant. usually i just stick to a regular iced coffee but i really enjoy a frozen one but out of 4 locations, only 2 actually made my coffee with oatmilk. the other 2 said they don't make any frozen drinks with oat or almond milk. almond i can understand as it's a big allergy risk. but are they just lying to avoid making this drink for me?",why is it some locations will make my frozen coffee with oatmilk and some won't?

27,DunkinDonuts,"recently, i have noticed that a lot of times whipped cream is not listed under add ons, but whatever location i'm ordering from, always has it. when i mention it to the employee at the store they never say they have heard this from other customers so i'm not sure if anyone else has this issue. i just got a new phone a few days ago and thought maybe having to install the app on this new phone would solve it, but nope. anyone else having this issue?",whipped cream not listed in add ons

29,DunkinDonuts,so like the title said the beloved brown sugar cream cold brew is gone. is there anything i can ask for that’s similar or add something to a preexisting drink to make it taste like it?,what can i ask for that’s similar to the bsc cold brew?
30,DunkinDonuts,"i recently switched from ordering iced coffee with milk and sugar to cold brew with milk and the brown sugar cinnamon swirl. 

when i would order iced coffee, i would usually ask for 1 or 2 skim milk in a medium, otherwise my drink would be basically beige. however since switching to cold brew, if i put 3 skim milk in a medium it looks almost black and all i can taste is the coffee and flavor swirl. 

is milk portioned differently between drink types or is my store just making my drink wrong? or does skim milk just not work in cold brew?",different milk portions for iced coffee vs cold brew?
31,DunkinDonuts,"so i went to try the new blood orange refresher and when i ordered i was told that it can only be with coconut milk???? the employee said that she wasn’t aloud to sell the concentrate without coconut milk? i’m so confused since it’s literally promoted without it.

any idea why?",blood orange refresher
32,DunkinDonuts,"i'm asking because i do like dd coffee when done right. i don't want to sound like everyone sucks or every store is like this. my only experience is with my store here by my house. 

sometimes i don't need a shot of espresso cause the strength is great, and other times i regret not getting the shot. sometimes my coffee is white as cream and other times it looks normal. i always order in store. 

i try to be understanding, and i feel so awkward going so often (1x a week for remakes). what can i do on my part to make sure my coffee stays consistent? i get 1 butterpecan, no added sugar, and 2 milk. i will add my own sweetnlow after i get my drink.",how strong is the iced coffee or cold brew supposed to be?
33,DunkinDonuts,"i was absolutely in love with the cold brew with the brown sugar cinnamon cold foam. 
sadly it is not available now so yesterday i got the cold brew with pumpkin foam and brown sugar swirl instead.  all i have to say about it is, “yuck”!  big disappointment. the foam had little flavor and the consistency was different. i wouldn’t order it again.  i miss my brown sugar cold foam drink.  i haven’t tried the cold brew with sweet cold foam yet.  any good?

40,DunkinDonuts,"so i’ve bought dunkin creamer 3 times. one was just the regular cream and the other two was the pumpkin munchkin creamer. every 3 times i bought it, it does this in my coffee? why? it’s just cold coffee from walmart. it’s not the coffee cause i use other creamers with this coffee, it’s only when i use dunkin’s. it makes me not wanna drink it cause it makes me think it’s spoiled. i have emetophobia so i’m scared to puke and i avoid anything that seems spoiled.",does this happen to anyone else

42,DunkinDonuts,i'm pretty much mainly stuck to drinking matcha and chai these days due to stomach issues. but for the most part i mainly just buy a small matcha. i know matcha has way less caffeine in general to coffee. but what size matcha would i have to buy to feel a good amount of energy like a small iced coffee?,how much matcha would it take to feel the same caffeine from a small iced coffee?

46,DunkinDonuts,"i have an interview with dunkin donuts in a few days. the job is a crew member. my responsibilities will include but will not be limited to thoroughly cleaning tables, obeying safety and sanitation guidelines, handling cash register transactions and pouring coffee. 

i have done research to find out what types of questions i can expect to receive during the interview. below is a list of possible questions and the answers i have drafted. i will gladly accept any feedback. it is doubtful that every single one of these questions would be asked, but some of them will and i don’t know which ones will and which ones won’t be asked, so i need to be prepared. please focus not on how likely it is that i will be asked these questions, but on whether or not the answers i have drafted would make sense had these questions been asked. 

**what are your strengths**?

i am a quick learner. i am enthusiastic and hungry to learn. furthermore, i take criticism really well. if i have done something wrong, i want to be told what i did wrong. therefore, you will never have to worry about me making the same mistake twice. 

**what is your biggest weakness**? 

with what little work experience i have, i am a work in progress. however, being so new to this profession, i can be shaped into the perfect employee. 

**what are your career goals**?

at the moment, i am in a discovery phase. in an attempt to find myself, i want a job that will remind me about the value of hard work and enable me to challenge myself. i hope to be able to multitask, so that i may learn, grow and develop. 

**where do you see yourself five years from now**? 

five years from now, i plan to still be working here. hopefully, i will have contributed to the company enough to be seen as a trusted and reliable member of my team. while still in the ame role, i would have a wide range of responsibilities. i would be the go to person for advice and expertise in my area. 

**when are you available to work**?

i am available to work anytime. 

**tell me about yourself**.

there is so much to tell, it is hard to know where to begin. 

in undergrad, i completed an internship working on nightly and weekend programming. this job enabled me to work with students who had learning disabilities. i would help to coordinate events. i would help with the set up and clean up. during the event itself, i would interact with the students and ensure that they were having a good time and obeying all school rules. if i am hired to work at dunkin donuts, it would be my job to ensure that the customers have a pleasant experience. 

**walk me through your resume**.  

i have done landscaping jobs before. i once shovelled snow out of the driveway of a customer who was unable to shovel himself due to back problems. i was self-employed and the pay was not steady. i had to seek out opportunities for work. i did not have the same sense or order that i would have at a job that takes place in a building where i punch in and punch out. that is why i would like a job like this, where i am told when to show up and what to do when i am here. 

i recently finished school. my major was psychology. i knew that the courses that i took in school were no guarantee of figuring out what i wanted to do with my life. however, by understanding human nature, i would be able to better understand the world, which would help me connect with people and figure out how to find work. 

my last semester of undergrad, i worked an unpaid internship on nightly and weekend programming for the thames program. the thames program at mitchell college is a program for students with learning disabilities. i assisted with the prep work, set up and cleaned up for many events. during these events, i would interact with and act as a role model for younger students. as an intern, there was a degree of creativity involved with the job, but for the most part, i followed orders given to me by my supervisor. i foresee this job as one that is mostly about obeying an employer. i intend to set up the place to open and/or clean up the place before leaving after closing. 

**how did you hear about this job**?

i received an email notification from indeed.com. i like challenges. this job is physically demanding, because you have to lift objects that weigh as much as 35 pounds. the job is also socially challenging, you must greet customers and ensure that people have a pleasant experience when the people in question are complete strangers and you do not know what they like. this job sounds challenging in a good way. this job sounds exactly like a challenging task i have been looking for this whole time. 

**why do you want to work at this company**? 

i want to work at dunkin donuts, because the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. 

this restaurant's target demographic is the working class. these are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. i take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average american. 

**why should we hire you**? 

my biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that i am a team player. in a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. having majored in behaviour science in undergrad, i have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. when i did community service for sacred heart school in taftville, i would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. therefore, i know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. also, i was a student-athlete in high school. from this experience, i built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**when did you have to work under stress? how did you handle it**?

when i completed an internship in undergrad, i had to complete 100 hours by the end of the semester. i dealt with that stress the same way i dealt with any other form of stress, by using the one year rule. if ever i am stressed about anything, i simply ask myself, will this still be on my mind in a year? if the answer is no, then logically there is no reason to be worried, as it will all blow over in 365 days or less. if, however, the answer is yes, then there is still no reason to be worried, as even if things do not go as planned, there will be plenty more opportunities to rectify what went wrong. i also ask myself this one question. what is the worst thing that can happen? stress is what you feel when you are not sure what the outcome will be and you know that the outcome could be undesirable. when you take a driving test, you feel stressed, because you might not pass. if you ask yourself what the worst thing that can happen is, you may be surprised to discover that the worst thing that can happen is not only pretty unlikely to happen in the first place, if it were to happen, it would not be that bad. 

**do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team**? 

i like to work as part of a team. i also enjoy working alone with close supervision. when i did my internship in college, i would interact with my supervisors, the other interns and my teacher. it was all up to me to ensure that i fulfilled my responsibilities. i was supervised in regards to the jobs that i did for the school, but it was my responsibility to ensure that my work was completed in time. 

**how would you deal with a conflict**?

if ever i dealt with a conflict, whether it be work related or inter personal, i would say to the other person the following; 

“it seems to me that you are upset or angry that something has been done wrong. would you please tell me what i have done wrong, why it was wrong and what, if anything, can be done to improve the situation?” 

that is verbatim what i would say in response to a complaint.

**how would you remain motivated in your work**?

i consistently ask myself; am i a better person than i was a year ago? and what do i need to do to become better over the course of the next 365 days? i think of it in terms of years, not days. everyone has bad days. you don’t know if you will improve from one day to the next, but there is no excuse for regressing from one year to the next. 

**what is your ideal working environment**?

my ideal working environment is one where everyone makes it a priority to build others up. no one is perfect. when a fellow worker makes a mistake, the appropriate response is to either correct the mistake or teach the person who made the mistake to correct it himself or herself. this expectation should apply in all directions, employee toward employer, employer toward employee and employee toward other employee.  

**is there anything you have done in the past that you wish you had done differently**? 

when i did community service for sacred heart school, i was tasked with vacuuming the carpets. i unplugged the vacuum cleaner before turning it off. i received a shock.  

**if you have a day when you are not busy, what would you do**?

i would ask my supervisor if anything else needs to be done, hoping he or she has a task for me. 

**why is it important for all policies and standards to be obeyed**?

policies, procedures and standards are set in place with the intent to work toward a common goal. if some people in a staff or faculty disobey policies, a common goal will never be achieved. 

**when can you start? when are you available**?

i am capable of beginning immediately. i am available to work any shift. 

**are you able to travel**? 

although i do not have my own vehicle, i will have transportation for scheduled shifts. 

**do you have any experience working in fast food**? 

i do not. 

**why are you interested in working with us**? 

i am a regular customer of dunkin donuts. every product, the donuts, coffee, hot chocolate, and breakfast sandwiches are amazing. i am impressed by the quality of the products, not to mention the customer service. if i work here, i can spread joy through a cup of coffee and make customers loyal to the brand. furthermore, the fast paced environment is my ideal workplace. 

**what do you know about the company**? 

when william rosenberg founded dunkin donuts in 1950, the company first did business in quincy massachusetts. the slogan “america runs on dunkin” is accurate. it is the most popular coffee seller in the country, measured by the number of coffee cups sold. dunkin donuts sells over 2 billions cups of coffee in a single calendar year. 

**why us and not our competitors**? 

as a loyal customer of dunkin donuts, i know that dunkin donuts produces products of much higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies. year after year, dunkin donuts has not dropped in quality at all. the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. this restaurant's target demographic is the working class. these are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. i take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average american. 

**why should we hire you**? 

my biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that i am a team player. in a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. having majored in behaviour science in undergrad, i have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. when i did community service for sacred heart school in taftville, i would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. therefore, i know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. also, i was a student-athlete in high school. from this experience, i built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**how would you deal with an unsatisfied customer**? 

i would offer my condolences, ask why the experience was unpleasant and ask what, if anything, i am capable of doing to remedy the situation so that it never occurs again. if it is possible to fulfil the customer’s request while obeying the rules set in place by my employer, i will do so. 

**can you work under pressure**? 

i can definitely work under pressure. pressure makes me a more competent worker. when i completed an internship in undergrad, the knowledge that i had to complete 100 hours of service by the end of the semester gave me the incentive i needed to reach out to people and ask if there were any favours they needed. when my professor told me that failure to complete 100 hours would result in an f for the course and course credit being withheld, i immediately knew that i needed to reach out and seek opportunities as soon as possible. 

**what do you foresee being the biggest challenge at this job**? 

i have always wanted to work here and never given much thought to the challenges that are likely to come up. i imagine i will face the typical challenges associated with a fast paced environment. i am sure that it will be nothing unsolvable. when i face a challenge or i am out of my comfort zone, there is no need to talk about how uncomfortable i am. my discomfort is my problem, no one else’s. i will deal with the discomfort myself one time. when talking to others i will focus on the positive. 

**what would you do if a customer asked to speak to the manager**? 

i would first ask what the problem is and whether or not i can help. if i can help, i will. if, however, i lack the ability to solve the problem myself or the customer insists on seeing the manager, then i will get the manager immediately. 

**how reliable are you**? 

i pride myself in always showing up and time, doing my best and receiving all the constructive criticism that is useful to me. if i am unable to show up, i intend to give my employer and coworkers notice well in advance. 

**how do you intend to provide excellent customer service**? 

i will always provide service with a smile. in other words, have a positive perky attitude when greeting a customer. i will lead the customer to a seat for an in house order. to ensure that the customer is attended to in a timely manner, i will be sure to sit or stand in a location where i can easily identify a customer and a customer could easily identify me. 

**what would you do if you caught a fellow employee stealing from the cash register**? 

i do not tolerate unethical behaviour such as stealing. i will report the theft in such a way as standard procedure dictates. this is rarely an issue for me in the first place, as the vast majority of people who i have ever met have proper respect for other people’s property. 

**how do you achieve proper work-life balance**? 

when i am not at work, i throw myself into my hobbies. i enjoy athletic activities like hiking, leisure activities like playing video games and intellectually stimulating activities such as reading classic novels and writing movie reviews. 

**what would you do if a customer ordered in house and refused to pay**? 

i hope i never have to deal with that, but should such an unfortunate circumstance arise, i would speak to security or management, who are trained to handle such situations. 

**what have you done to better your understanding of this field in the last five years**? 

in school, i took several classes in psychology and marketing. this taught me a lot about the economy, customer service, human nature and how to behave professionally. 

**how would you prioritise tasks during a busy period**?

the customer always comes first. 

if i am in the middle of setting a table and a party enters as the phone is ringing, i would drop what i am doing, escort the customer to their table, answer the phone and then finish setting the table in that order. 

**how do you intend to blend with our existing team**? 

i have pretty good communication and people skills. i respect people’s boundaries. if the employee is more experienced than i am, i will look to him or her for guidance

**do you have any questions for me**? (this is what the interviewer will ask). 

a year from now, assuming that all goes as planned and i get this job, what will i have to have done to make you glad that you hired me? how will i know if i have done a good job?",are these good answers for potential interview questions?

49,DunkinDonuts,"is this just me? i get dunkin multiple times a week and more often than not, the cup fails to do what its meant to do. every time i tilt the cup and take a sip, 6 or 7 drops start dripping down the side. ive had to use wet wipes on my center console 2x this week",leaking coffee with every sip
50,DunkinDonuts,"hi dunkin,

i have a dunkin’ donuts near my place of work, where i pick up “cold brews” 2-5 times a week. i’m not a huge coffee snob, but i did work at dunkin in college, and can easily distinguish between cold brew and iced coffee. dunkin’s iced coffee is much more bitter, more watered down, a slightly lighter color, and leaves bean dust floating in the bottom of your drink. cold brew, being around a dollar more, is higher quality and tastes better (imo).

so i guess here’s where the snobbiness comes in… i can tell that i often get iced coffee in my “cold brew”, and it quite honestly ruins my day. some days it’s just straight undrinkable, or full of bean floaties, or an odd grayish color (presumably because it’s watered down remaining iced coffee). i’ve tried clarifying that it is cold brew, i’ve tried asking the cashier if they still have cold brew before i order, i’ve even asked the barista which they used. i have never asked for a remake, and i’m really trying to avoid that, but i will lose my freaking mind if i wind up with another “cold brew” that tastes like coffee piss on ice.

when it comes down to it, if the cashier would honestly tell me that cold brew was out, i simply wouldn’t buy it that day. i’m much more a starbucks gal, but this dunkin is the sole remaining covid survivor in my area. it’s my only option for coffee i didn’t make myself. i’m not trying to be an asshole, i definitely don’t want to make the employees miserable….. but how on earth can i get them to be honest with me about the contents of the “cold brew”, and is there any way to avoid a weekly gamble? is it okay to complain? is it fine to ask for a remake/ refund? i know i hated remaking drinks, but then again, i took the high road and told my customers when i was out of cold brew….

anyway, friendly reminder to all, customers can tell the difference when you sub in the cheaper products. if you’re out of something, please be honest. if you mess up, please correct it. all i want is my cashier to honestly tell me when they’re out of cold brew - that’s it. but instead, i get constant promises that it is indeed cold brew…. and half the time, it’s not.",consistently given iced coffee instead of cold brew?
51,DunkinDonuts,"ok, tell me this isn’t weird. almost every time i go to my local dunkin, they take a huge, banged up metal pan, shove it through the window and scrape the asphalt with it after a car drives off. after several times seeing them do this, i asked the guy why. he said that they do it to “grab the change that fell on the ground” ??? but each time i see them do it, there is no change in the ground and they sure as hell ain’t picking it up with that thing.",local dunkin scrapes metal pan on ground at drive-thru

and while i don't go to dunkin for the food, it's nice on occasion. an egg and cheese sandwich (no meat!) is $6.03. that's just unreasonable.

what do the basics cost at your dunkin, and what price would be the breaking point for you?",how expensive is too expensive?
112,DunkinDonuts,"this is just me ranting, but i'm losing my mind.

when i first started working at dunkin, i loved it. there were some hiccups, with me not quite being trained properly, but once i learned everything it was awesome. i liked my coworkers, hell i even liked my manager most days. we all worked well as a team and everything, for the most part, ran smoothly. 

but then our manager quit , and they hired a new manager. although she claims to have prior experience as a dunkin manager, i swear to god she has no idea what she's doing. everyone here welcomed her and tried to help her adjust to the store (our store had been renovated recently so we had a few machines that were different to what she was used to), and she was great.. for a few days.

 i had a week off for a vacation soon after she joined, and when i came back everything had gone to hell. i wish i was exaggerating when i say 75% of my coworkers had already quit, without even a 2 weeks notice. from what i heard over text, she wasn't listening to the hours people said they could work and was scheduling people when they weren't at all available, but then getting mad when they said they couldn't come in. a few times, she left a gap in the schedule where no one was scheduled to be in the store. the store, left completely unattended, for several hours. machines were breaking because she refused to learn how to use them properly. she'd come on the floor to ""help"", make a mess, and then leave and expect everyone else to clean it up. and in my experience since i've come back, it's all true. i've specifically said i cannot, under any circumstances, work opening shifts. last week she scheduled me for exclusively opening. i texted her, again, to tell her i couldn't, and she told me i had to ""figure it out and find someone to cover."" i switched with a girl who said she couldn't do closing shifts and only got closing shifts. 

now that we're constantly understaffed, we're all just trying our best and, yes, we're taking shortcuts. shoot me, sometimes i'll make a latte right in the cup instead of putting it in the metal tin first. or i'll bounce between stations instead of sticking to one because we don't have enough people to staff every station! and when i'm closing i have to leave my coworker out on the floor by herself to go to the back to do closing chores because we don't have anyone else to help. but she is constantly nitpicking everything and saying it's ""not standard!!"" but it's literally the only way we can get through the day anymore.

i came in yesterday, and said hello to her on my way in. without even saying hello or good morning or anything, the first thing she said to me, at 6 in the fucking morning, was ""why did it take you more than 10 minutes to do boxes yesterday?"" it was truck day, i had literally an entire stores worth of supplies that we had unpacked from boxes, and all of those boxes had to be broken down. anyone who works at dunkin knows that is dozens of boxes, and most of them are too big to fit in the dumpster at all so they have to be cut and well broke down before they can be taken out. and that's not including the 2 minutes each way it takes to pull the trashcan to the dumpster, and you usually need at least 2-3 trips (if not more). and i told her all of this, and she said she didn't care, and that next time she caught me ""wasting time"" she'd suspend me.

the only thing keeping me here at this point is that almost no one in the area is hiring, and the very few people that are hiring are hiring for jobs that i am so not qualified for. but i swear i've never felt more mentally drained.",thinking about quitting
113,DunkinDonuts,"this also applies to most other meal delivery services.


baskin robbins has a core set of flavors that we must keep at all times, and a rotating monthly array of the other ones determined by both dunkin brands and the franchisee. this is also true for toppings, ltos and niche items such as mangonadas. 


**doordash does not recognize that the flavors change and will show all of them as available!**


as such, when the order comes in, we must wait for the driver to come by, let them know the missing items and hope that the customer answers their phone. if they can't answer the phone, the driver cancels and another is sent over and over until either the customer picks up their phone, we decide to substitute something similar and write a note, or the customer cancels on their end.


at least at my location, we cannot cancel orders on our end for doordash. so please either call ahead to ask us what we have or be ready to answer the doordasher's call/text! it makes the situation much smoother and easier for all parties involved (plus you get your stuff faster!)

thanks for understanding!",psa for people trying to doordash dunkin/baskin dual stores

115,DunkinDonuts,"been working at dunkin for about 3 weeks now and i don't know if i should keep working here, they put us in this groupchat and the manager keeps complaining about things not being done all the time. she also doesn't want us to lock the doors at night, but the neighborhood the dunkin is in is so sketchy. i see why my coworkers were locking it. i don't know how to make any of the drinks just refreshers and iced coffee. it feels like some of the people around me, especially the managers don't have patience with me. i close with one manager all the time and sometimes i ask him stuff, he doesn't respond. like can he hear me or is he just ignoring me? also when i first started working there, they told me they only had morning shift from 5am- 4pm and 1pm-9pm. i went with 1-9 because i take public transportation and wouldn't be able to get there on time. fast-forward when i start working i see that one of my coworkers works from 9am-4pm. i confused and brought it up to the assistant manager who hired me, she reiterated that they only have those hours and i have to talk to the the store manager. why should i have to talk to the store manager if shes the one i talk with about my hours ever since i was hired? also she rejected my hours on the app after it being up there for a day, but she rejected the as soon as i said something about seeing my other coworkers schedule. idk seems like some petty shit to me. anyways what do you guys think? i'm thinking of quitting and working at amc theatres, they are hiring in my area.",should i quit?

125,DunkinDonuts,"hey y’all. i have a favor to ask for anyone that has a moment of downtime today. will you pull a “large” espresso shot into a large *iced* cup for me? i know dunkin doesn’t use “measured” shots… just “s/m/l” buttons on the machine… and i’m just trying to gauge how that looks in a large iced cup without anything else added in. 

***reason: financially can’t keep going to dunkin as often as i normally do (and honestly really shouldn’t)… so have moved to a home setup. i know coffee isn’t a “necessity”… but it is one thing that keeps my mental health up. it’s the thing i look forward to, my one treat in my crazy life. my daily drink is a large french vanilla swirl iced latte. the only thing i’m missing now is the appropriate amount of espresso. so if anyone has a moment to spare, i would be so grateful. thanks y’all!",anyone working today? downtime favor!

127,DunkinDonuts,"i just became a baker and i am curious what your normal night looks like. i started this last week and a brand new location. they had said my hours would be a specific time, roughly 7 hour shifts. 

so far i have been baking and frosting roughly 600-700 donuts, plus croissants, bagels, muffins, munchkins. by the time i just get everything glazed and and frosted i am usually at roughly 11 hours, and they also expect me to put all the baked goods in their respective places and then wash all the trays and sweep and mop the store. which takes about another hour and a half or so. i just don’t see how any of this is remotely possible. they also said as time goes by they expect production to go up once people get used to the new location being there. i have been doing 12-13 hour shifts to finish things and i am absolutely miserable. 

is it like this everywhere? do other locations have multiple people baking? i know some locations get their donuts delivered so not every store bakes their own. 

any tips?",question for any bakers out there
128,DunkinDonuts,"this probably only happens last minute when i want a drink at dunkin. so i go in i have them scan my phone for the points and then i pay with my card. when i tend to forget i can just quick reload the money onto the dunkin app, have them scan my phone and pay &amp; get my points in one shot. hopefully next time i remember this.",i don't understand why i don't make things easier for myself lol
129,DunkinDonuts,"although working at dunkin taught me to be kind, generous and polite to people that just want their coffee, the location i worked at was so bad. i worked there for over a year, and there are so many incidents of drunk + high coworkers, bullshit, equipment failing and falling apart and ridiculous amount of hours that were cut from everyone. i finally had enough one day when i was closing from 2:00 to 7:30 (30 hours a week), and my other coworker who only works till 7:00 had the audacity to not only hit on my mom (she was dropping off a car for me to drive back home), but give me a hard time and yelled at me for some stupid shit that i don't want to explain here. i had my two days off and finally had enough and put a 5 days notice because i was just not happy working there anymore. i know i would feel guilty if i hadn't put a notice in but i really wanted to ""give it to the man"" and just walk out, like so many people before.

i managed to save about $4,000 this summer before going to school and hopefully finding a job there instead. dunkin taught me that it cannot be hard to run a business, something i want to do in the future. just be kind, polite and don't put up with any bullshit and you will be successful. i swear you can get anywhere and successful in life just by treating people the way you want to be treated. all in all, we all go through bs in our lives, working at dunkin or not, but its best to just keep moving forward and not give a fuck.",i finally quit
130,DunkinDonuts,"as much as i love dunkin, the app is just frustratingly bad for something that was created by one of the world's most successful coffee chains.

all the time, i open the app to find that my saved gift card and credit card info have just completely vanished. i'll go to check out and it'll say ""add payment method"" as if i didn't have anything saved. i restart the app and then they magically re-appear.  

half the time, the app randomly decides to not let me check out---the ""place order"" button turns grey and won't let me do anything. i've found that the only way around this issue is to delete the order and completely re-select everything. 

and don't even get me started on the mess that is the points system. the ""deals"" they have often don't even work. my app currently has the ""mobile order an iced drink on monday and get 100 points"" deal going on right now. so i ordered an iced latte on the app this monday and the points never came through! this isn't the first time that this has happened!

i will say, however, the app sometimes messes up in a good way lmao. for instance, after i redeemed my free birthday drink in-store a couple months ago, the reward never left my app. so the next day, i used it in a mobile order and got a second free drink haha. and then just today, i was using another free drink reward i had. the drink was all that i ordered---so i paid nothing, but my app is trying to say that i spent like $15 in that transaction and gave me 60 free points for it.

has anyone else dealt with these issues in the app, or is it just me?",the app is a hot mess

134,DunkinDonuts,"hi everyone.  can someone help me identify and provide a picture of a donut that dd had a longgg time ago in the 90's, but got discontinued?  it was / is my favorite dd item and the best way to describe it is that it was a heavily glazed, dark croissant.  it was brown in color and long; not circular.  the best part about it was that it was so dense and flaky inside and the outer coating of this item could be peeled off to reveal the flaky dough inside.  it's definitely not a french crueller, cronut, glazed stick, original stick, or jelly stick.  i saw a reddit post talking about an 'original crueller' item which may be it, but the frustrating thing is that i can't find any pictures at all online so i'm not sure.

today a woman came up to the counter while her teenage daughter was ordering and exclaimed, “how is it even legal that your bathrooms are closed and you’re serving food?!”

several people also questioned whether our bathrooms were “really” closed, as in if we just closed them for the convenience or if there was actually a plumbing issue. we had another woman tell us to hand her a “fucking cup” because she was gonna go “piss out in the parking lot.” dunkin customers are a different breed lol!! 

i just wish i could be candid and tell them that i can’t even take a shit during my 8 hour shift, let alone drink water because then i’ll be suffering with a full bladder since i cannot use the restroom. people are wack. please treat employees with respect if you frequent dunks, thank you!!️",bathrooms closed- karen freaks out
158,DunkinDonuts,"today at work was a nightmare. got in at 8am, clock in, and go to beverage 1 where i'm assigned. immediately i notice our ac is down. it's 95 degrees outside, we've only been open four hours but all of the donuts look melted and disgusting.


then i go to make a drink and notice is that the sticker machine is printing the writing huge, so only the first few letters of each ingredient are being shown on the sticker. ex. 1 cre, 2 fre, 4 su instead of 1 cream, 2 french vanilla, 4 sugars. and for frozens it would just say ""(size) frozen"" and we couldn't tell if it was a frozen coffee or frozen hot chocolate. so i had to keep looking on the screen to try and identify what i was making. 


after figuring out what the first drink was i went to put cream in it, only for the dispenser not to shoot anything out (despite at least half full.) i try to use the other machine, same issue. i manually open tiny creamer packets, pour them in, and tell my manager so she knows it's broken.


next i fill a blender to make a frozen, and pass it off to beverage three for them to blend it. i hear them freaking out, look over, and the machine wouldn't stop dispensing ice. it was supposed to make a small coolata but it has completely filled the blender with ice and was still trying to dispense more. we had to shut down the machine and couldn't do frozens again for the rest of the day.


i got swapped to drivethrough later in the day, and noticed that our drivethrough window wasn't automatically shutting like it was supposed to. this would've been fine, seeing as there wasn't ac or anything so it's not like it could get any hotter, except it was rainy and the wind was blowing all the rain into the store. had to keep manually pushing/pulling on the window to get it to close and open.


not only was the rain getting in the store, but it was raining so hard that i was practically screaming into my headset and the people in the drivethrough couldn't hear me still! and then they'd get upset that i wasn't taking their order even though i was trying to, and i had to explain at the window that it was just because of the rain.


then my manager made me take the trash + all the boxes out. in the rain. on truck day, where i had 5 trash cans worth of boxes + 2 trash cans of actual trash.

personally i would not want a lid on my coffee that's been on the floor where melted ice water and peoples shoes are intermingled. maybe i am not well versed in knowing weather rinsing floor juice off of things counts as sanitary.  so i am looking for opinions.. is it reasonable to rinse? or should they be tossed?",if it hits the floor it's trash.. right?

169,DunkinDonuts,"returned back to work today after my day off, came back to a nice surprise of the big redesign of the dunkin app. 

according to the paper (which i forgot to snap a pic of!) all of the southern california dunkin’s are going to be the first dunkin’s in the country to transition from dd perks to dunkin rewards. the transition will happen later this month or next month. 

i saw a post posted yesterday or the day before talking about this change. if you want more information on the transition check out that post, however to summarize the change, more rewards than just a free drink like sandwiches, donuts and more! only downside is the good drinks are all obtainable by acquiring 500+ points making it harder to get to the free drink reward..

178,DunkinDonuts,"i work at a dunkin where we do things relatively informally, so i’m not clear on the rules in this area completely. recently, i’ve had 2 customers be short a penny, so they reached into the tip jar and used that penny. the first customer actually asked me and i told him no, so he gave me the extra dollar (he had the money to pay) but didn’t want the change so he gave me a penny he got from our tip jar and demanded a dollar anyway, despite me telling him it was our tips and he could not have it. my boss was sitting right behind me so i didn’t make a fuss, but it really bothered me. i probably would’ve just given him the full dollar in change(not 99¢) if my boss wasn’t right there and if he was actually nice. i’m relatively new, so i’m not sure if i’m wrong here, but it seems so disrespectful to use money from our tips, no matter the amount. especially because that’s not even the business’s money, it’s the workers personal money. it was the action rather than the amount. is this against the rules? i don’t want to make a fuss over a penny but i don’t want people to keep thinking it’s ok and keep taking more. what should i say when someone does this and what should i do if they do it anyway? i already said “no sir, those are our tips”, but that didn’t stop them. any suggestions would he appreciated. btw, i told my boss and he said “people do that sometimes i don’t know why” but didn’t seem bothered.",customers paying with money out of our tip jar

after it happened consistently for a month, i reached out to dunkin corporate, who referred me to the manager, who had me come in for a free drink. i told her i just wanted to be assured that people will just put on the drink what’s advertised and she said that will be the case from here on out. and it was for like a week, then it just reverted back.

195,DunkinDonuts,"my mother can be a bit much sometimes, honestly i don’t even know why she bothered to order just a black coffee, but we don’t have a coffee maker right now so i can’t shame her on that too much. she likes to claim allergies because she read the “how to karen” handbook that says apparently claiming allergies will get it absolutely removed, but even still…. i guess i should start at the beginning.

we went to dunkin today because i wanted a coffee since i’ve been up since 5am due to a new medication schedule that ain’t working for me. we go in because the line in the drive through was a bit long. i ordered my usual(butter pecan with oat milk iced latte), my stepfathers cappuccino blast because ours is the fancy baskin robins conjoined twin, and my mother wants a “black coffee ice blended thingy” me trying to translate “just a blended black coffee”, she asks for no dairy or sugar of any kind because she is on a “diet”(and thinks she’s better than us for it), now i don’t care about her ordering it without dairy or sugar or anything because if she wants to drink her bitter burnt coffee beans i’m not going to stop her.
i redeem my free beverage for my drink because why not. we are waiting for our drinks, mine and my stepfathers are finished first, and now we’re waiting on my mothers. the girl comes over and asks if my mother wants whipped cream, i understand why, some people ask for no dairy or dairy alternatives but still get whipped cream but my mother gets the karen hair up her ass and freaks out “i said no cream! i only wanted a frozen blended black coffee!” despite the fact she knows that i get panic attacks over any person getting outrageously upset, i manage to hold together despite wanting to gag my mother with the dish towel.
well, for some reason the girl becomes very upset over this and cops an attitude. like i can understand my mothers attitude not being the best, not by a very far margin, but the girl began acting like my mother had held her down and called her names.
“well you ordered a cappuccino blast.” the girl first goes “that’s my husbands yes, i am allergic to dairy!!” (honestly not sure if she’s allergic or lactose intolerant like me, she claims she had some joint pain and felt swollen and bloated the last time she had some dairy). i explain my mother just wanted a black coffee blended up with ice, while my mother is freaking out and going “i just wanted a black coffee with ice!”(leaving off the blended part entirely which probably is what spurs this next part), while one girl is going “i’m going to fix this for you ma’am.” the girl comes over and slams down a cup of just black ice coffee in front of my mother and walks off. while another girl is explaining that if my mother wanted it blended, it had to be done with dairy or cream in it which honestly doesn’t even sound right to me, but i don’t work there so whatever. as we are leaving the girl calls “have a good day ma’am!” after my mother as i am trying to herd her out the door.

i am not condoning my mothers attitude, not by a minute, but i do not think this girls attitude was the best either by any mile. i am left wondering if i should even bother complaining?",should i complain?

197,DunkinDonuts,"to put it shortly, i was working for a few days during training time, then was put on a 2 day schedule to work 6 hours, then later given 1 day a week of work for 5 to 12, with some days being 6 to 12 and 7 to 12. then this past month, my boss called and transferred me over to another dunkin but gave me more hours to work. i worked four days from 5 to 12 under a new manager. but after one week with that crew, the manager realized that she had too many people working on the same shift and needed to send some back. so, she sent me back but didn't tell me even though she said she would give me an update friday. i found out sunday of by the district manager that i was sent back and i would get a call from my old manager about the days they will want me to work. 

i got no calls that whole week. i left a message the following monday and got an answer back on tuesday that they're putting me on mondays but are trying to decide what time. i didn't hear anything else the whole week until today that i'm getting mondays but working only four hours. i might come in this coming monday but the scheduling has made me consider quitting, maybe after working that monday. because it feels like a waste of time. they might be oversaturated with workers since it's the summer and this is popular place to get a summer job, and i don't want to deal with high-stress for that low a pay. not again.

i don't know if this is the right move yet because, while i'm not desperate, and i just mostly wanted answers when i called last week to see what was going on, i don't know if it would be the best move to abruptly quit after being given some work hours. i'm of course searching and applying to other jobs but i haven't heard back from any hr reps yet. i also have another job but need extra money to pay off some bills and dunkin pays quicker since it pays weekly. what should i do?",so my hours were reduced to 4 hours on one day a week. might quit. should i?

so, i've noticed it is just me (a female) working overnight with my co-worker who's a dude. majority of this dunks are all men besides my manager and two-morning shift workers. we are always together doing the work and i refuse to leave my ""space"" on the drive-thru area because these early morning shift guys (the 4 am crew) give me an uncomfortable vibe and i hate the way each of them stares at me when i'm just trying to do my job and i have caught each of them staring at me in a weird way especially when i'm bending over to reach something from the ground level. almost three weeks ago, the guy who is responsible for being on the front counter and opening up, said to me ""maybe i can help you get better sleep"" with a wink after i complained that i will be tired when i get home and even if i try to sleep, i have two kids under the age of 6 who need my care. when he said that, i felt disgusted and gave him a glare and told him that wasn't cool which he laughed off. then a week ago and this week, he purposely tried bumping into me so he can feel my ass while i'm making coffee orders in the drive-thru (he's a big average guy but c'mon, there's still space between us but he makes it seem like its cramped). my co-worker has been observant of this behavior ad has told both my manager and me about it and he hates it because all i'm trying to do is my job and i'm already in a committed relationship with kids. my manager has reported these guys and they each have a history of making other (ex) female employees uncomfortable that they either transferred out of the store or quit. my manager has also spoken to this guy but he's back at it with his lewd comments and giving me that off creep vibes. yesterday after leaving, my co-worker stayed behind to count his register and he heard these guys (including the cleaner and other male crew members) talking about how ""f\*\*\*able"" i look, how my ass looks, etc) and my co-worker snapped at them by \*again\* telling them that i'm 27 and happily taken, and to stop talking about me like that. 

they all laughed at him and kept on with their conversation.

i'm disgusted, repulsed, and don't feel comfortable showing up to work in this kind of environment and i'm sure anyone else will agree. i have vented to my husband about these issues and it has made him very pissed off that before i was ready to clock out this past sunday, he came to pick me up but went straight to the front counter to ask for my manager and she was there and can see how pissed he was and is aware of the situation that she asked him to follow her to her office and talk to him about this and showed him her reports she has made against these guys. all my manager can say is that if i want, i can call hr/corporate directly and just make a complaint or threaten them with a harassment lawsuit because she has made numerous complaints and all these guys get is a ""slap on the wrist"" and my manager's boss has already made it clear that they don't want to fire anyone because the dunks i work at is very short-staffed already..

idk guys, please share your opinions about this or message me privately. i'm to the point of just quitting or relocating but this store is the closest to my apartment and if i chose to be transferred, i know i'm gonna need to travel and don't have a car at this moment.",sexual harassment at the dunks i work at..

251,DunkinDonuts,"i have recently started drinking coffee and have become absolutely addicted to dunkin' donuts sweet cream cold foam cold brew. i now want one like every day. but buying a 5 dollar coffee multiple times a week has started to put a serious dent in my wallet, not to mention the closest dunkin' to me is also like 20 mins away which adds up in gas too. so i decided to start trying to make it myself at home when money is tight or i don't have time to run up and grab one. but so far, the ones i've tried making at home aren't nearly as good as the ones i get from dunkin. they're just not as sweet and creamy. i was wondering if someone who works/worked at dunkin' would be able to tell me how they make it or atleast help me get mine tasting closer to dunkin's or correct any mistakes im making. i usually get a large sweet cream cold foam cold brew with 4 caramel. when i make it, i just use whipped cream for the cold foam and made cold brew and bought caramel from the store. i read online that 4 caramel at dunkin' is equal to one oz but that seems a little light. it doesn't taste as sweet and the caramel i bought doesnt mix well and floats around in clumps in the coffee. is there a specific kind of caramel i should use or some ingredient i'm missing? anyone who could help me get this to taste as close as possible to dunkin's would be greatly appreciated.",would anyone who works/has worked at dunkin' be able to tell me how to make a large sweet cream cold foam cold brew with 4 caramel?

so i work at dunkin, and when i'm working a long shift i'll usually buy myself something to eat (at my store we don't get free food or anything, just a discount). i usually pay with the app because i don't wanna go get my bag from the back, get my card, and then put it all back. but i'm getting all these free drinks offers and i just.. don't need them? i get free drinks while clocked in and because i work most of the week i don't really go to dunkin outside of work.

my question is, if i screenshot the qr code and give it to someone else, will it work when they scan it off the screenshot? and still take it off my account (meaning it couldn't be used again)? additionally, this wouldn't break any tos/rules would it?

258,DunkinDonuts,"anyone else have really bad management at their store? 
my store has been having short drawers at the end of the day i and many others discussed it with my manager about solutions and who’s been stealing money. we have caught it but we don’t have cameras and haven’t for months so nothing has been done to fire the person. he recently said we will finally be doing drawer counts after each person uses it. which is great but he hasn’t been doing it till today he made it a big deal to make sure my drawer was counted multiple times. even stopping me mid transaction to do so. everyone was confused as to why he was singling me out i haven’t stolen anything and i really don’t want him to try and pin the blame on me for pointing out flaws in how everything is set up. he’s fired others who’ve done the same but for reasons that make no sense. we’ve talked to his boss but even he doesn’t do anything and just laughs at us.
it’s a problem for me because 
i don’t want to be accused of stealing falsely and lose my job.
not only that but he asks me to come in on my days off and early sometimes i can’t then when i don’t sends me home early 2-3hrs into my shift i feel like i have a target on my back and i might be the next one fired despite someone who’s been stealing from the drawers tips and supplies and someone accused and proven to harass female workers including minors.

259,DunkinDonuts,"i have to share this with someone because this one customer we always get is.. interesting to say the least.

apparently she's a regular, but because of my schedule i've never seen her before. however, my availability changed so ive been working earlier hours, meaning i've started to encounter her.

my first time meeting her was today when i was working drive through. it wasn't super busy and she walked up (yes, walked) to our drivethrough speaker asking for a free water. i said okay, because it's just water and it was a super hot day, and called out to my coworker asking for a medium water. (my stores policy is that we can give away mediums or smalls for free, but larges have to be paid for.) she walks up to the window and i told her like hey, it's really dangerous to be walking in a drivethrough and could you please just come inside? our lobby was open, and i was kinda worried a car would pull through and wouldn't see her (our drivethrough has a weird blind spot, which she was standing right in the middle of). she said no and that she needed her water, so i went to go get it quickly before she got hurt. i brought it out to her and told her to have a good day, before walking away from the window to go do something else.

a few seconds later i hear pounding on our drivethrough window. i go back over and she's slamming her fists on the glass, screaming that she wanted a large. i apologized, told her i wasn't allowed to give away larges for free. she reached in my window to dump the medium onto the floor and said ""no, a large."" i went to get my supervisor and hep was just like ""oh, yeah it's her, just give it to her."" i was just in shock. gave her a large and she went from hysterical to happy in seconds. walked back up the drivethrough (towards the speaker, not the exit??) giggling and drinking her water. she yelled ""thank you!"" at the speaker and walked away.

i still don't know how to feel about it to be honest. everyone else at work has seemingly just accepted it but i'm just like.. why do we let her get away with this? i feel like at the very least someone should call someone for her cause i feel like with the way she's acting she needs help, genuinely.",crazy customer
260,DunkinDonuts,"ordering at the window is generally not okay. i let some stuff slide by like adding a few drinks when it’s slow or a donut or two , but you cannot try &amp; add full orders at the drive through. especially if you’re only ordering at the drive through to attempt to avoid the extra cost. ((i.e. extra swirl, whipped cream, “can i add a tomato pesto &amp; 3 hash browns?”, hot not iced and vice versa)) be responsible. know what you’re ordering, be ready to pay when you add last minute things. they still cost the same &amp; it’s not fair to the people behind you who have also been waiting 10m b/c people keep either changing their minds of their order or attempting to add more to their order while at the window. be conscious &amp; be kind. coming up to the window with an attitude after you forgot something isn’t okay either. the people who serve you are just that people. don’t be surprised when you won’t be served b/c you’re rude are acting a hot mess. i always can help, i actually love helping people out, but not with that attitude !",human decency is free btw

273,DunkinDonuts,"i really like dunkin grilled cheese sandwiches; but, the issue is they are usually toasted only on one side. because i order from many different dunkin locations, i’m assuming this is the official cooking procedure (i’m guessing to meet order time quotas, or some other corporate agenda… because otherwise, a single-sided grilled cheese sandwich is not fathomable). 

i tried to ask in the drive through to cook both sides, and the girl said “okay, so you want it ‘extra toasty’”. i thought that was dunkin lingo, so i started ordering them that way, “i’ll have a grilled cheese sandwich, extra toasty” (i felt foolish saying it every time).  the results were hit or miss; so, i figured “extra toasty” isn’t actually a dunkin term… the girl just said that.

so, i went back requesting them to “toast the sandwich on both sides, please”.  it’s still a roll of the dice. sometimes it’s perfect, sometimes it’s double-toasted on the same damn side and not toasted on the other side, and once they just assembled it and gave it to me untoasted. but, usually it’s the same way… toasted on one side.

don't get me wrong, i'm not against smoking. it's your body, do what you want with it. but for starters, i (and i'm sure plenty of other dunkin employees worldwide) am asthmatic, and inhaling whatever you're smoking while i'm trying to serve you is unpleasant at best, if not potentially dangerous for me. second of all, it just smells like shit. like sorry but after getting 10+ cars a day that were smoking i'm going to smell like weed and cigarettes and in my opinion both smell awful.

\- they order 'well done hash browns' as if it's a steak or something. i actually laughed when someone ordered and asked them what they meant, dude says, just put the hash browns in the oven for 2 rotations. i highly doubt that's what he really wanted.  

\- ""let me get a small black iced coffee with 2 shots of x, 2 sugar, and some caramel"" 

\- i had a guy order a black hot coffee with 3 creams, no sugar. gave it to him, he complained it had 3 creams. same guy proceeds to order again, 2 frozen medium coffees. give him the first one, buddy loses it and screams that he wanted a small. i told him ok i'll give him a small even though he paid for mediums. 

\- i had someone order 3 sandwhiches, then goes to wait, next person ordered a small coffee and a glaze stick. i give him it. first customer comes over and starts getting in my face about someone else getting served first. i said he didn't order hot food, the customer goes ""well he has the same bag"", i was actually dumbfounded at how stupid you gotta be to say that and think that that is how things work.

\- people really think as i'm making someone's coffee they can order by yelling at me their order. i usually just ignore these tards.

\- people that wait in line and come up to you and go ""i ordered on the app"", like okay.

\- people that come in complain we don't have their mobile order and then i look at their app and tell them they ordered to a different dunkins. very satisfying especially when they're all worked up over 'our' error. 

\- had a guy scream at me for a blueberry donut, i said i'm too new here to understand where they might be and he points to the cornbread donuts and asks for that one. not sure if he was happy with the result.

\- had another guy scream at me after i asked him to confirm he wanted 2 coconut donuts.

\- had a crazy ass lady that spent her whole day sitting in the dunks ask for the dragonfruit refresher in a cup and ask if it would be free. like, what.

\- have multiple idiots that think the tip jar is a 'take a penny' type deal. it's not.

\- people who don't move out of the way after they order when there is a line.

\- had a dude scream at me ""when am i gonna get my coffee i been waitin here for 5 minutes"" during a rush. we are 2 people working, ive been there at that point a week probably.

\- had another dude get his croissant wrong it was chocolate not plain and he lost his mind and walked out yelling fuck this instead of waiting for a plain one to be heated, literally does not take even a minute. 

\- people that are rude / yell at you then come back in and pretend it never happened, naw ur service is gonna be slow as hell and i'm going to be rude back to you. 

\- some of these peoples coffee orders are legitimately disgusting and sometimes half the cup is full of flavoring shit, like u see the posts on here all the time about nasty coffee orders, it's true and a good chunk of the time it's ordered on ubereats/grubhub/doordash.

\- people talk to you like ur a computer, i understand the hey how's it going , may be a bit annoying but if u walk up to me and just go ""medium hot coffee black"" im gonna be a little annoyed , 99% of the time these people are boomers.",been working here 3 weeks now : i believe 85% of customers are idiots
297,DunkinDonuts,"my coffee was made wrong. no cream in iced vanilla, which i definitely ordered. i asked if it was mine. dd person said yes. i stated i ordered it light. so what does she do next? literally takes the cover off as she throws the coffee at me. right an my broken foot. now i have to live with a cast that reeks of coffee. did she apologize or show anything but disdain for me? nope. i left, leaving the 2 coffees behind. why is this acceptable behavior? never again will i set foot in a dunkin’s.",then this happened…

299,DunkinDonuts,"ok so today i went to dunkin' and i ordered one jelly donut with an order of hashbrowns. i used a gift card that was connected with the dd perks app so that i could get my points in since it was my first time using the account. a couple of hours later, i check the app to see that i got 400 bonus points?! is this a glitch or did i just get a deal that i didn't know of?",does anyone know why i got 400 bonus points?
300,DunkinDonuts,"hey folks, i work morning shifts (usually 6am). would munchkins or donuts be made yet? i don't know when dunking workers start preparing donuts and have social anxiety in person and on the phone so this is my next best shot.

tia",best time in the morning?
301,DunkinDonuts,"so this morning i ordered my usual cold brew and strawberry donut. i usually eat my donut on my ride to work. i pulled off, got a couple minutes away, open my bag, and found a small dead bug on my donut. i’m already running late for work at this point so i didn’t turn around. instead, i sent a lovely email with pictures to the customer service email and got back “we requested the store representative follow up with you. we’re sorry this restaurant let you down. we hope you’ll give dunkin another chance again soon”.

i never included the address of the store however it was provided in the response  email from them, meaning they pulled up my account based on my email. they can see i go to dunkin literally everyday. 

i see a lot of posts on this sub of people complaining about the smallest things and getting points towards a free coffee. i didn’t get any thing. granted, i was told someone would follow up so something may come of that, but how likely is this?",how likely is a store representative to follow up?

303,DunkinDonuts,"so our manager left our store for a week and left us unprepared, and we have no official shift leads or assistant manager. we were short staffed yesterday and had a few under experienced people working drive thru counter register as i was the only one who knew ss. and as it came back it was so called short by 29$ from someone who’s in training. are they allowed to take that money from our paycheck?",can a manager take money from us if a drawer was short?

305,DunkinDonuts,"i know there are already threads about this but i'm hoping the more we all freak out about it, the more corporate eyes see it and maybe, just maybe bring it back.  


i am absoluetely devastated over this. i'm 33 and have been ordering this drink since i was a teenager. it was definitely a comfort drink i got for special occasions or whenever i was traveling since i'm not an every day dunks person. i don't drink coffee and only make tea at home because buying it at dunks is silly to me, so this drink just made me so happy. a way to my heart. 

&amp;#x200b;

the chai latte and vanilla chai laette is shit in comparison. i've managed to find one place locally and one in new hampshire that still has the powder left over and made me one. i tried buying the powder yesterday in nh and they wouldn't let me. 

&amp;#x200b;

can anyone tell me how it's made? i'm friends with a mobile coffee shop owner who says she makes a similar drink and i would love to try and get it replicated. i cannot remember what kind of milk it's made with though? also, and this seems like a dumb question, but is it black tea or chai tea? recipes i've found online in the past have said black tea. i know other ingredients in the powder include cinnamon, nutmeg, and a crap ton of sugar.",dunkin has officially discontinued the vanilla spice (formally vanilla chai) and i can no longer sustain life on this planet
306,DunkinDonuts,"here are some things i’ve noticed that bug workers and customers alike 

1) if you are ordering a dozen donuts and you want to pick them out dear god do not do it through the drive thru. come in. also donuts typically sell out by 1pm so if you come at 5 and ask for a dozen you will probably be let down.

2) if you want cream or sugar please say that. if you want a specific amount, tell the person. so many times people assume the employees just know their order and know how they take their coffee and then get mad when it doesn’t come out the way they wanted. also- we don’t mind re making drinks at all.

3) if you say you want a medium black coffee with caramel in it- then it’s no longer a black coffee because the swirls have milk built in. 

4) if you place your mobile order a minute before you come it won’t be ready. and if you place it and come thru an hour later everything will be melted. my best advice is to place it before leaving your house so it will be ready when you come.

5) if you have two separate orders please tell the person at the window instead of just starting at them and not leaving the drive thru. sometimes it’s so busy the order taker doesn’t have time to notify the cashier that someone has two separate orders and people will just sit in their cars looking into space for 5 minutes instead of telling you they had a second order. 

6) if you pay in all change i will personally take 10 minutes to count it and hand your food out, i get if it was a $2 bill but if you give me $8 worth of dimes and nickels and are rude about it (most times) then i will take my sweet old time doing it. 

7) most important- we are just people like you we are just doing our jobs and it’s just coffee. if it is wrong, ask nicely and it will be remade. so many people treat food workers as personal servants and get mad when they aren’t catered to during a rush where everyone is doing 5 things at once. be patient and nice and appreciate that it’s just coffee and mess ups can be fixed :) i can tell you that the regular customers we are rude are very well known and all the employees know who is rude and who isn’t before they even come up to the window. and the regular customers who are sweet bulls relationships and we are happy to see them!",tips for customers
307,DunkinDonuts,"i have a free beverage to use. i've been getting macchiatos with caramel swirl or recently cinnamon brown sugar swirl with whipped cream. skim milk and no sugar.

i like macchiatos for the 2 espresso shots and contrast in flavors. what could i try for a new enjoyable flavor? cake batter seems like it's almost flavorless.

310,DunkinDonuts,"i ordered my usual cold brew yesterday, and i saw the brown sugar cinnamon flavor swirl and thought i'd try it. there was a glitch in my app and it reverted to flavor combination i had changed my mind about, so i ended up getting 2 bsc and 2 french vanilla with my usual cream and sugar mix. 
it was awful! there was absolutely no flavor swirls to be found, not even vanilla. i hate being that customer that goes back in ""eew my drink isn't right!!"" so i just dumped it out after a few sips. 5 bucks literally poured out on the concrete.

316,DunkinDonuts,"share your worst dunkin experiences either as a worker or customer. i’ll go first! 

i went to dunks last week and had the worst experience. i have never complained but i wish i had in this case. 
pulled into the drive thru, dunks was empty. sat at the mic for 12 minutes until someone finally spoke up. teens were laughing and goofing off, but i really just needed a coffee so i stayed. ordered a small black iced coffee with sugar and avocado toast. 
pulled to the window and couldn’t see anyone in there. sat around for 10 minutes before i almost left and finally a woman came by. she looked cooked out of her mind and asked me again what i had ordered. i repeated my order twice to her and she repeated it back to me and charged me. she then handed me a medium hot coffee with xx, and i swear someone had already drank from it because there was pink lipgloss on the cap… 
annoyed i just explained my order again and she apologized. 
i see her goofing off with some guy through the window, and i waited for another 10 minutes. i got so annoyed i knocked on the window. pissed this time i just kindly asked for my coffee and food. she then handed me a wet bag and a small iced coffee with some type of swirl in it. i wound up leaving rather then complaining. 
got home and the avocado toast wasn’t out in the regular box, it was wrapped in a napkin, soggy wet, with brown avocado spread… 
i wish i had the courage to complain, but honestly the employees gave me such an off putting vibe i didn’t want to put up with them. i’m debating writing in anonymously to the manager because now that i have shared my experiences my siblings and friends also had bad experiences with those two as well. my dad even pointed out that the guy doesn’t even work there, or just is never in uniform. and the woman often had her kids back there with her.

as far as i could tell, up until yesterday for my first cold brew order ever, i could order a cold brew and it would be $3. i went to order today, and even tried to through the app, but i could not get the $3 deal unless i order the brown sugar cream cold brew. i did not order that yesterday but still got the deal. i read that this deal had no strings attached (except nitro cold brews) so i was confused. i even showed the person that took my order the deal from the actual app and they told me nope, just the one specific drink.

351,DunkinDonuts,just because it won't be over the top busy like a morning coffee shift. shouldn't mean you have one person handling all the work load. i go in as a customer as various different locations in nyc and i see this all the time. and the crazy thing is most these locations still be very busy late into the night. i was ordering a drink yesterday and there was like two people ahead of me. then all of sudden by the time i ordered there was 3 people behind me. and i'm like damn there should at least have someone working the register at night while the other handles the drinks. it's kind of also not that safe to have one person work a night shift alone. idk just a random thought i had after i seen dude juggle all those orders last night.,it's so messed up how dunkin has only one person working overnight shifts at most locations
352,DunkinDonuts,so i recently decided to go and try different coffees. i just realized recently the butter pecan was the syrup not the actual coffee itself. go figure. anyway i look it up and saw it’s over 60+ for the syrup from dunks brand itself. i saw that torani makes butter pecan syrup as well. i like what they make and often can find them in tj max. does anyone know if it taste like the dunks one. like it does not have to be the exact but enough that it will leave me happy. my dunks sometimes makes my coffee right.,butter pecan.

354,DunkinDonuts,"i have seen many people complaining how their cold brew had only brown sugar foam and no syrup in there. and i know exactly what is happening lol. 

dunkin menu (check the app) has two varieties of these drinks:

1) brown sugar cream cold brew: this drink comes with brown sugar foam as well as brown sugar syrup. 

2) cold brew with brown sugar cold foam: this drink is only cold brew with foam on top and no syrup by default. 

if you go in app --&gt; order --&gt; crafted cold brew, you'll see both these options. 

now what is happening is either you're ordering number 2 above expecting number 1 or the person taking order is confusing between the two. but both options exist on the menu. 

solution: spell it out lol. whatever way you are ordering, in app or drive through, let them know you want x number of pumps of syrup and brown sugar cold foam on top. easy peasy :)

367,DunkinDonuts,"hey guys!

i had a really weird experience happen today and wanted to share with you guys. today i got a cookies and cream milkshake, and the workers took a really long time. i did not mind as i wasn’t in a hurry, and there were no other cars infront of me or behind me. when i received my drink, it was very watery and not at all like the previous milkshakes i have had. i did not want to be a “karen” so i drove off and took a sip, but it had no flavor and was definitely not like any of the previous milkshakes i have had. due to this, i decided to turn around and take it back to the store to ask if he could maybe remake it. i was really nice and asked him if he could remake it, and the worker replied with “the drink is perfectly fine, if i remake it it’s just going to be the same way, so idk what to tell you.” i was perplexed, i have never received a response like this at any establishment, so i just asked for a refund. the worker then said i don’t know how to do refunds so just come back another day. 

this was such an odd experience, and the dunkin donuts i went to has had some recent problems, with many of my friends complaining that since they switch employees so often, the employees are new and sometimes mess up the drinks. this is totally fine, and was my initial expectation, that maybe he was a new employee. but saying that you will not remake the drink because you made it right is such an odd way to reply to such a request. i wanted to share in this sub because i love dunkin and this has never happened before, and to be honest made me quite sad.",employees being rude to customers

as of yesterday, they responded. i plan on talking to someone from there and we can take it from there. but finally, the first steps of unionizing are underway!!!!

i ask because i've noticed if i order ""1 cane syrup,"" it always is sweeter than when i order 2. i believe the app represents 1 shot by removing the quantity altogether, which i suspect most employees read as ""they want the normal amount of cane syrup,"" which is 3 shots.

i'm interested in how they train u guys cuz at starbys they're so strict on amounts. like we have to fill ingredients up to certain lines on the cup, shake drinks a certain amount of times. for our brown sugar oatmilk shaken espresso we have to shake the cinnamon bottle twice. for lattes/cappuccinos we have to steam the milk for a certain amount of time. we even have set patterns for how we have to drizzle caramel on the sides of cups + on top of drinks.

438,DunkinDonuts,"my go-to drink is a large iced macchiato. i notice the ice is literally almost to the top of the cup- maybe about a half inch to an inch under it. i see there are lines on the side of the cup marked ""1"" and ""2"" way further down- are those lines supposed to be used for ice?

it just feels like i'm paying over $6 for mostly ice. i know there's an option for ""less ice"" if you order ahead but i've been afraid for a macchiato either they won't fill the cup then, or it will throw off the ratio of milk/espresso. any insight if it's supposed to be made with that much ice or not? should i be trying that ""less ice"" option? i also count calories and don't want to throw it way off if i end up requesting less ice and just getting more milk- but then i wonder if the little liquid i'm actually getting in the drink is *really* 380 calories if the cup is mostly ice.",how much ice is there supposed to be?

441,DunkinDonuts,"hiya. 
some info- i live in a small town in new england. dunkins quite popular. husband works at various job sites and frequents a dunkin location 2-3 times a week, goes to other locations the other days. 
i place his mobile orders for him through the app every time he needs it which is often. 
i am placing these orders 10-15 minutes before he arrives at the locations. why? because the food part of the order is only ready half of the time. so we figure give them lots of extra time to have it done. but it happened again this morning. i placed the order at 6:45am, husband walked in at 7am. drink is ready, food isnt. 
weve never been offered refunds, never even really complained to the workers because we arent the confrontational kind. at this point im just irritated for my husband. he doesnt have time to get in line and wait after finding out his food isnt ready for 10 mins. hence why we use mobile ordering in the first place. so he can walk in, get his stuff, walk out. for months they just...never gave him the donuts he ordered. now its whatever food he gets. the drinks the only thing present. 
i wish i had a record of how often this happens. it sounds ridiculous but we've been doing this for over a year, and i want to say at least 30-40% of the time he walks out without breakfast and is upset, to say the least. 
i called customer support this morning.. guy says he will bring this up to the specific stores owners/managers and have them call me. not looking forward to that as its a small town where everybody knows everybody.. this has the potential to get uncomfortable. but we are pretty fed up after so many repeats of this.","mobile orders only ever half ready, really irked."

my manager just talked to me on now they’re trying to improve mobile order sales to get a kiosk machine by november! she said we’re almost at the goal but we need more.

447,DunkinDonuts,i was just thinking about this when i was making food. we use black trays that are reusable so when we make bacon the fat spills over the sheet we use to cook on. wiping them down still leaves some bacon fat. eggs and hash browns for example can pass the protection sheet and touch the bacon grease if not cleaned properly busy days were just inna hurry so deep cleaning them isn't done untill closing. but dam we go through alot of bacon lol.,i wouldn't get food if you can't have pork.
448,DunkinDonuts,most of the time i order a macchiato and a few times when i went to pick it up it didn’t have that layered look a macchiato has it looks very brown and mixed. even if you mixed a macchiato it still wouldn’t look as dark because there’s more milk than espresso. when i taste it it tastes like really watered down iced coffee. is it possible that they would just serve me iced coffee instead of the macchiato? i don’t bother speaking with them becuase what am i going to say it doesn’t look or taste like a macchiato? and they’ll be like yes it is or whatever. this happened a few times already,second time this happened !

457,DunkinDonuts,"hey everyone, i just became an overnight baker a few weeks ago under the assumption that most of my shift would be overnight, but it's not. i come in at 1:30 to prep for store opening at 4:30 which includes making the coffee, baking the frozen croissants, bagels, and muffins, putting the shipments of donuts up etc. and once the store opens, i switch to opener and work till 10 am upfront. the owner is teaching me but she is very pedantic and always stresses me for time even though i just started. i also have to remember all the things as a baker and upfront which i didn't sign up for, and thought i would have no customer interaction. i asked if we could start earlier but she said no because the goods wouldn't be fresh by opening. i also asked if there were any other hours i could work, but also said no. my coworkers said overnight is the least desired role due to the excessive nature of the position and the particular nature of the owner. i am also a bad multitasker so the myriad tasks i have to get done in 3 hours is sort of overwhelming for me. i tried to stick it out for 3 weeks, but it doesn't feel like it's getting any better. are all of the overnight positions like this at other dunkin's? i would like to know others thoughts and if i should suck it up.","just became an overnight baker, did i get tricked?"
458,DunkinDonuts,"okay, so this has been bugging me for the past few hours ever since i ended my shift today at work. so, i work at the local dunkin's in my town and the day was mostly good. one of my better workdays even. i'm new and have only been there for a month and a half by now. today, during one of the last hours of my shift, i was trying to fix the donut case. it was almost noon and there were two empty spaces at the top that i wanted to fill with two single trays of donuts that were at the bottom so i could cover the last shelf with the blinds once it was empty. 

this girl who i just met last week starts coming over while i am thinking about putting them next to the big trays of donuts and is like ""you probably can just leave the space empty because i'm going to move the muffins over there."" now the muffins are perfectly placed at the top and usually sitting there in the other case because they're supposed to be. not to mention there is a full single tray of each muffin next to each other. the second case was looking nice. there were cases with single donuts, and i would gladly move them to a different tray that has space, but sometimes the manager tells me to leave them in their own tray, so we don't confuse the customers. plus there were plenty of donuts in other trays, and spaces between the trays at the top that needed to be filled and they would perfectly be there, if i just placed some in the middle at the top and fill any empty spaces with some donut trays at the bottom, like my supervisor usually tells me to do. 

i don't know if this girl is returning employee or new, she might have been the former, but i was a little confused when she told me that she was going to transfer the muffins there. i mean, i've seen other co-workers just do what i was initially going to do. when i told her what i was about to do, she was like ""i'm just telling you this because i'm closing and am going to put the muffins over on this case instead"". i told her i was just putting some on there for now so there wouldn't be empty gaps because i know our boss doesn't like that, and i placed a tray of boston kreme at the top to fill a gap. she just said ""okay, you can do that for now,"" but then i saw her walk over to two of our other co-workers who were just standing there by drive-thru looking at us, and she looks like she was saying something to them, and then the other co-worker she was talking to said ""yeah, that's how everyone else feels,"" while she was looking right at me. and i was like ""are they talking about me?"" 

like, what does ""everyone \[supposedly\] feel""? because i wasn't trying to be a jerk or know-it-all. i know i'm new i was just trying to follow what i was usually told, especially since i had tried to put different pastries on certain trays and told to ""keep some in their own trays instead and focus on filling the gaps"". plus, i still had chores to finish before my shift ends and fixing the donut case is one of them, so i didn't want to just stand there and do nothing. i immediately asked  the other two co-workers if i had made a mistake and explained what i was trying to do. they told me  that they might move stuff over soon, so i was like ""okay"". 

i then told the girl that i'm just ""leaving some trays up there to fill in the gaps for now"" because i didn't want to leave the case looking incomplete like that. then she was like ""okay, it's just that i have a certain way of doing things when organizing the cases."" and i was like ""okay, i understand."" i was like, 'alright, i'll leave it to her. she probably is just a returning employee and have done this many times already. it's whatever. my only issue is that fact that it seems like she was talking about me or what i was doing to the other co-workers and one of them was making a passive-aggressive comment while looking in my direction. i didn't know exactly what the girl whispered to her, but with what she did immediately after what i said i was trying to do, it seems like this is what happened. 

you could easily guess what the subject of their mini-chat was about at that point. and i'm thinking ""okay. i'm not trying to step on anyone's toes. i'm just trying to do my job. if this girl has something to say, she can say it to my face instead of being a fake b\*tch and trying to say something behind my back as if i wouldn't notice. as for the other co-worker, she's said some mild condescending shit before (did on my second day of work, if you remember my post about that), but she's usually upfront with me on some stuff if i've made a mistake. i don't need that passive-aggressive nonsense just because i wanted to just fill the remaining gaps on a donut case. you know? like, i don't have time for that toxic bs. it's rude and petty. like, if i was making a mistake here by not letting her do it before my shift ends or something, my bad, but it does not warrant that behavior. not to mention the fact that they seemed a bit standoffish when i was clocking out for work annoyed me, too. like, it's not that deep. have any of you ever dealt with something like this months within your start at dunkin' donuts?",i'm wondering if my co-workers were talking shit because of something small i did at work.

i have heard say that the reason it lasted only so long was because it wasn't aimed at plant based people. it was one of those ""veg* products mainly aimed at health conscious omnivore"". it was vegetarian but not vegan. if it has used no eggs and non-dairy cheese or even no cheese, maybe it would have sold better.... *maybe*?

i order through the app, is this possible that they are seeing and reading the ticket wrong so consistently? or am i just going insane. also, i’ve noticed that when i order the same drink from other dunkins, it is sometimes darker. i notice a lot of inconsistencies with how drinks are made at different dunkins. should i stop using the app and order in person from now on?

what’s the deal with the online order merging lane in the drive-thru? this idea is absolutely ridiculous... at what point is considered acceptable for rude drivers to blatantly try to cut others in line simply because they’re in the merging lane? they need to wait until someone is courteous enough to let them go ahead of them. even then, that entire idea in itself is downright unfair to other customers who’ve been patiently waiting to place their orders behind the merging point. other customers end up getting stuck waiting when someone else in the other lane thinks they’re more “important” because they ordered on the mobile app. a lot of these people in the merging lane almost run into other people’s cars just to solidify a place in line! it’s a terrible design imo. if you want your mobile order so badly, go inside &amp; get it. stop making problems for other people in line &amp; wait your turn like everyone else!

609,DunkinDonuts,"for back ground: i’m 18, and recently, about 4 months ago started a job with dunkin (side note: highly do not recommend) i’ve seen my co-workers deal with karen’s but i’ve never dealt with one. 

i got to work at around 3:25pm after having a panic attack over missing part of my uniform and overall having a bad day and being late. i clock in, put my stuff away and go to the front. 

there’s a lady standing at the donut racks looking irritated, she looked at me and and said “we’ll are you going to help me?” and i politely said “sure if you come over to the cash register i can get your order started” 

she comes over and starts her order, 18 munchkins and 2 custard filled donuts. after confirming with my co worker, i tell her we don’t have any more. she immediately cops an attitude, saying how ridiculous it is we don’t have donuts. i just kind of sit there until she decided on a new donut, she wanted bismarck, again, we’re out of that. at that point she throws her hands down and says “fine i don’t want any of it. i want a refund.” so i put the munchkins and donuts away. 

i’ve never done a refund before, ever, so i try to ask one of the older girls, who tells me to text the manager. i text the manger who, is no help. so i figure it out myself after sitting there for 20 mins trying to figure it out, about half way through she asked to speak to a manager and my manager wasn’t there and she responded with “so they’re having people who are useless and worthless at their job working with out a manager? wow” at this point im trying not to cry, im shaking violently, i haven’t eaten or drank at all at this point, im tired and not having a good day. 

i sit there and i don’t say anything and i figure it out and accidentally refunded for 14 munchkins and the two donuts instead of 18 munchkins so literally $1.05 was missing. she, once again, called me useless at my job and she wanted the managers number who was ignoring me now. she was yelling at me and i genuinely thought it was the system because i double checked and thought everything was okay, luckily at this point my managers boss came in and helped her, the lady switched her attitude with her and wasn’t rude at all while i was sitting there trying not to break down sobbing in the middle of the lobby. 

once my managers boss left i immediately went to the freezer and sobbed for a good 5 minutes. luckily i had awesome customers the rest of the day :)

610,DunkinDonuts,"idk if anyone will remember but i quit dunkin and made a post when it happened and well... the combination of people not hiring me for 4 months and needing money desperately had me asking for my job back. honestly, nothing changed-- besides the employees i once worked with quitting as well. but this also meant there were the same annoying customers, the same exhaustion of only getting 9.75 an hour and the same dread at the end of the day that i had to wake up early in the morning for a company that doesn't give a shit about it's employees.

i hate seeing articles like this because it really just shows that people don't understand how menus work. you can get any flavor in a coffee. a caramel cold brew is not a different menu item from a normal cold brew. that's why they separate the flavors from the drinks on the menu.

what makes it even worse is stuff like the final entry ""caramel cold foam cold brew,"" where they say they don't know if it's the same caramel that goes in the foam as that which goes in the drink. like, no, the foam comes from a can and the caramel swirl is a syrup.

dunkin' to me prides itself on simplicity that allows you to customize your drink how you want without being pretentious with their menu. so it annoys me when articles and people tackle it with the same mentality as they do starbucks.",article dumbness
631,DunkinDonuts,"i got a large iced coffee, 4 cake batter swirl, 4 blueberry, no sugar, cold foam. i usually get almond milk but i forgot to add it. it was... ok. the cake batter was hardly noticeable. i would get this again, but, like others have said, maybe add in an extra pump of cake batter.

as for the cornbread donut, i couldn't finish it. it was the consistency of the sour cream donut (which is what i usually get) with gritty corn meal. it also had a preservative-y fake sugar taste. very weird mouth feel. i will not get that again.

let me take a second to mourn my favorite swirl, red velvet/pink velvet and my favorite donut, the celebration donut. my life hasn't been the same without yall.",short cake batter swirl in iced coffee and cornbread donut review.
632,DunkinDonuts,"ok, i understand it isn’t the trainees fault.. however, it’s so frustrating having to do everything. it was only 2 of us due to being understaffed.

closing time is always busy. our dunkin is in a very congested area so people are constantly coming. last night i literally had to clean, get donuts, cook, ring it up, handle the front, etc. the trainee didn’t know anything. i had no time to train her either.

so many people kept coming with these big ass orders &amp; eventually i just started crying. i took my headset off &amp; just went to the bathroom. it was so much pressure trying to do everything while training someone. i closed the dunkin super early (which we aren’t supposed to do that at all). but at the moment i didn’t care. i couldn’t do it. it was ridiculous.

i work with the trainee again today. i’ve asked my boss to do something but again… we’re understaffed. it’s so much pressure.. but whatever. thanks for listening",working with a trainee during closing time (rant)
633,DunkinDonuts,i went over to pick it up and i don't think they added the milk. it's too late now but is there any way i can get a refund or prevent things like this from occuring?,i got a sunrise roast today with almond milk and 1 pump vanilla. i think my drink was made incorrectly however.
634,DunkinDonuts,"this is a question mainly catered toward employees. my usual order is a small iced coffee with cream and only one pump of swirl. when i order at the drive thru speaker (as opposed to mobile ordering), i always specify one pump of swirl and the screen with my order reflects that! the label then comes out also reflecting the “1 caramel swirl” or whatever it is. 

however, when i mobile order, the label does not come out with the “1” but rather it just says “____ swirl” without any numbers in front. my question: as an employee, when you see this order come up for a mobile, do you know to only put one swirl?? sometimes it tastes like there’s way more than just one. i’d love to know!! thanks!!",1 pump of swirl

640,DunkinDonuts,"oh boy what an absolute shit show this was. i went to the dunkin closest to my gym after a workout. and this location is always hit or miss so i should have known better.

i ordered a ""medium iced cake batter latte with whole milk""

they gave me a medium iced *coffee* (cake batter) with oat milk. okay no problem, people make mistakes. another barista remade it.

except this time she put a large iced cake batter signature latte on the counter. i asked whose it was. i thought maybe someone else ordered a cake batter signature latte *because i sure as hell didn't*. the barista said, ""this is what you ordered"". i said no i didn't. 

she upgraded me to a large signature because of their earlier mistake, which is my guess. which is fine. but i don't want a 700-million calorie bomb with the whipped cream nasty mocha drizzle sprinkle bullshit on top. ugh. i just wanted a basic bitch iced latte with 3 cake batter swirls. why is that so hard? 

anyway, i didn't ask them to remake it, said thank you and walked away. i think if you're going to upgrade someone's drink, ask them first: ""would you like me to upgrade your drink to a large signature as a courtesy?"" 

taste test: initial sip i get a massive sugar alcohol taste. it reminds me of old-school starbucks french vanilla frappuccino's. i honestly don't taste cake batter. just tastes like heavy french vanilla+alcohol. it's not the worst swirl i've tried. but i can't say that i am a fan. i definitely prefer the butter pecan now that i've tried both. with butter pecan i can still taste the espresso. whereas with this one i don't taste coffee at all. it just tastes like sugar alcohol. so yeah, looks like this is a dud for me and i probably won't buy it again. #bringbacksaltedcaramel",my review of the cake batter signature latte

my go-to order is iced latte ( and chive mini bagels!) with no flavor , just espresso and milk , and for the most part stores get it right, but there is this one store that always puts more milk in it, so it doesn’t taste right. i’m not a super picky person but then again, i’m not paying to drink straight milk. so what should i say when ordering? what’s the ratio of coffee to milk? i thought they would know how to make it since it’s really basic, but apparently i was wrong.",iced latte question!

664,DunkinDonuts,"on the dunkin’ app when you reach 200 points you get a free drink, but not if you use almond milk. false advertising? this has annoyed me for some time that a multi million dollar company, has the balls to charge for almond milk or oat milk or coconut whatever it is. regular milk free… alternative not free. a free drink should be free no matter what milk  you use. 
thoughts?",free!! but not really.
665,DunkinDonuts,"this is based off how my stores machines operate. 

for 2% milk and skim, request specifically 3-5 milk. specify a number. if you don’t, it’ll just say “milk” and most employees will use the lowest setting unless a number is specified. these milks (and cream) get dispensed from a machine. 

for dairy, almond, or coconut - at my store we literally eye these unless it’s a latte or macchiato. i would ask for the cup 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 filled with milk. pls don’t take too much advantage of this and try to shortcut a latte. lattes are made with espresso so it will not be the same no matter how much milk you put in. 

if you’re dining in, ask the front counter person to communicate that w/the staff cuz i don’t think the pos has a way to note that. and if you just say “3 almond/oat/coconut” some stores are eyeballing it and are more bound to mess it up.

702,DunkinDonuts,"hello, i am a dunkin employee, and during the pre-february window, i made a little post where i went through each of the new items before they were widely known, and i missed the valentines/march one, so i guess i'll do it now. since there's only three new items, (somehow, lemonade is already on backorder... geez.) i'll also give some personal drink recommendations and a weird story.

&amp;#x200b;

cake batter swirl (in a small iced coffee, cream only): okay, this is the one i was looking forward to the most. i love cake batter flavored things, and this was pretty great. for some reason, when pumping it it comes out thin so ask for a little extra. it's sweet, but when trying to mix swirls together it gets muddied up by the other flavors. 8/10

butter pecan (in a small iced coffee, cream only): when i got hired last september, we still had some and god, there is definitely a reason why everyone loves it. it's sweet, nutty, everything great. i don't care if the ice cream market looks at it as a geezer flavor, it's a 10/10!

mango pineapple refresher (sample cup of pure concentrate): okay not gonna lie, it's underwhelming. it just tastes pineappley with not much other substance to it. my mistake for doing that. 4/10 

mango pineapple refresher (green tea): the green tea brings something out of it at least, giving it some depth besides fruitiness. 6/10.

mango pineapple refresher (coconutmilk): i'm sorry, but if i'm going to try this, i need an ambulance crew on standby. a little coconut is fine, but having a drink being half-coconut milk would probably kill me

&amp;#x200b;

now we're in the weird stuff

strawberry shortcake 2.0: ask for a vanilla bean coolata with 2 pumps strawbery and a non-cautious amount of cake batter. if you thought the vanilla bean + strawberry on it's own was great, try that.

""illegal"" lemonade refreshers: if your dunkin has bottled lemonade, ask for any of the refreshers with just concentrate and room in the cup. put the lemonade in. this has been my go to drink for the past few weeks.

butter pecan hot chocolate: as simple as it says. butter pecan swirl, hot chocolate. good stuff, even despite the tummy trouble because coconut oil in the hot choc

plain yeast donut: so... our baker called out 2 days ago so we had way too much stock. out of curiosity, i bit into one of the plain, unfrosted yeast rings and... eugh! it's floury and salty with nothing really redeeming to it. it's like scraping the underside of 20 english muffins and not toasting them. if you see that hollow excuse of something out as a baker's choice, avoid it!",i tried the new available flavors so you don't have to (again!)
703,DunkinDonuts,i changed from costco kirkland organic bold k ups  to dunkin original k cups (drinking like 5 in the am) and i seem to have headaches that don’t go away. any thoughts or insight appreciated. ,how weak is the original blend (hot)?

705,DunkinDonuts,you guys might remember me for my nail post the other day. my boss came in and literally screamed at me for having fake nails. yesterday my check came in and was missing 250 dollars. when i informed my boss she said i’m wrong and she will see me tomorrow to make sure my fake nails are off. has anyone had a short check? i’m not sure how to handle this. and if she comes in just to yell at me for my nails and not bring in what they owe me should i quit? when i addressed her about it i was nothing but nice. i said “you know i know mistakes happen and my check was definitely missing 20 hours.” she responded with “well you called in a day” which i didn’t i’ve only been early to my shifts. and how does a 8 hour shift loss explain 20 hours??? anyways i guess i just really needed to vent.,workers

708,DunkinDonuts,hey guys i’m ordering on doordash and every time i do it’s not sweet enough. i’m getting a large iced vanilla latte with almond milk. but it wants me to chose the shot or swirl. i know i want the swirl so i did french vanilla but should i be adding more than one? i think that’s why it hasn’t been sweet enough. ordering the deconstructed way is confusing lol,confused how to order
709,DunkinDonuts,"please realize that most of our stores are understaffed and under trained. please say vanilla shot instead of french vanilla if you want the shot and not the swirl. please don’t cuss me out when i tell you that we closed fifteen minutes ago. please realize that cooking food takes time when we only have two ovens and many different food orders. please realize that ordering four large hot lattes will take at least five minutes when we only have one espresso machine. please just realize that most of us are stressed and doing our best, so just be polite.",dear customers…

711,DunkinDonuts,"idk if its easter rage or what but customers this week have been way more likely to freak out and scream at us over nothing. 

we maybe get one customer a week who flips and starts yelling at us over super tiny issues. just how fast food is. 

but this week so far we’ve had: man screamed “you should be fucking fired” to the manager because i asked what kind of avocado toast he wanted, lady called us “fucking idiots” and sped away because we were out of orange juice, and just generally customers have been much snippier and rude. driving up to the window while i was asking them to clarify and ending up with messed up orders, interrupting me while im taking their order, snatching stuff out of our hands, taking the wrong food bags and then getting angry that we made “their” food wrong, snapping fingers at us when we cant immediately stop what we’re doing to make their coffee instead.

714,DunkinDonuts,are you guys allowed to have fake/ and or painted nails?  my boss keeps trying to tell me i can’t have them but i’m really not having it. there’s not long and obnoxious. i’ve only worked there a month and me and the manager are the only two that do doubles every other day and come in for people so they kinda have a lot of nerve in my opinion. honestly wouldn’t have gotten taken the job if i’d known lbs. they affect me in no way shape or form. anyways just wanted too rant also  have a good night everyone,employees
715,DunkinDonuts,"i’m from maryland and always get a blueberry sweet tea. i have a big sweet tooth and so this is my favorite drink from dunkin. when i travel back to pennsylvania for college, i’ve noticed that the same drink taste so different in pennsylvania than in maryland.

724,DunkinDonuts,"imo this story perfectly sums up the usa: rushing to work this morning i made sure to order a sourdough sandwich no meat american cheese through the dunkin app (wonderful invention). 

i picked up my food and unwrapped to see bacon and white cheddar. ok, i know it's obnoxious but i'm allergic to pork and dd white cheddar tastes like melted plastic. 

walked back in, ""please could you remake this i know it's annoying but i'm allergic to pork and i ordered american cheese"". ""mhm..."" i get in response. ""redo on the sourdough no meat"" the cashier relays to the sandwich station operator 3 feet away from me. ""and american cheese,"" i piped in already loathing myself for being that person. 

walked back out with my new sandwich and unwrapped it to start cooling off and staring right back at me is the disgusting plastic shine of the dunkin white cheddar cheese.

725,DunkinDonuts,"so every time i order a large iced coffee through doordash, i make sure to add 4 creams and 4 sugars (which i’m told is the standard for a large) but for whatever reason it seems like i get significantly less cream and sugar than if i actually go to dunkin and just ask for “cream and sugar”. for anyone who actually works at dunkin, what am i doing wrong when i order through doordash? wish there were an extra option to just add the standard amount of c&amp;s for the size.",why is iced coffee ordered from doordash worse than ordering in person?

729,DunkinDonuts,"hey! i noticed during the past 2ish weeks that my local dunkin hasn't had the strawberry refresher flavor available on the app. i thought that i might as well ask if they had it when i placed an order in-store today in case the app just wasn't updated or something. the cashier said ""sorry, we don't have the strawberry dragon fruit flavor anymore."" he didn't say ""at the moment"" but ""anymore."" surely it isn't discontinued right? the menu of upcoming spring items that's been floating around still lists it for refreshers iirc. any info would be great, thanks!","""we don't have the strawberry dragon fruit anymore""?"

732,DunkinDonuts,"just a few years ago seems like dunkin always tried new coffee flavors. now they just keep the same boring flavors and keep getting rid of them instead of adding more.

734,DunkinDonuts,not sure why but every cup of iced coffee i’ve gotten lately is bitter. i hardly even enjoy going to dunkin’ anymore. i’m hoping it’s just a swirl thing as i was a hazelnut drinker when there aren’t any seasonal options. butter pecan is my absolute favorite and if this year disappoints i’m afraid i will be done with dunkin’ after six years of going at least once a week.,it’s been off lately..
735,DunkinDonuts,"i know this has been asked before, but i'm having difficultly finding an exact answer. some articles say it's a tablespoon, some articles a teaspoon. most articles say a small gets 2 cream, medium 3 cream, large 4 cream, etc. what they don't say is how much (in tablespoons, teaspoons, or milliliters) is 1 cream, exactly? 

i know they use light cream (not half n' half), but 3 tablespoons of light cream for a medium does sound like a lot of cream for 14oz of coffee. that coffee is creamy though :)  


second question - is the cream included in the total volume of a coffee, or is it the 10, 14, 20 oz coffee plus appropriate cream amount?

in my frustration, i sent an email to dunkin customer relations, relaying the experience, the complete lack of customer service, and the fact that they didn't even try to provide a substitute, but just told me to leave.

i got back a boilerplate email response, telling me that my experience had gone to the franchisee, and i was refunded the total of the item i had been denied.

considering the absolutely horrendous experience i had, i am not putting up with such a canned response.  after multiple terrible experiences, and now getting such an uncaring and shallow response, it's time to forget about the loyalty program, and just grab a coffee or doughnut where i think might work.  7-eleven has them, kroger has a doughnut bakery.  we have thornton's in the area.  krispy kremes are around.  i am not going to throw my money at a company that gives me such a bad experience every few months.

760,DunkinDonuts,"just applied to my local dunkin’ donuts and i start my first day of training this saturday. my manager told me i get 3 days of training. wonder if it is paid or not (let me know if dd has payed training or if some states/areas don’t require it). personally, i don’t think 3 days is enough at all. the menu has a lot of items and lots of various drinks and i don’t even go out and get drinks so i don’t even have the slightest idea of how it works. i have just ordered a latte once, that’s all. i have a cousin who works at another dd and he had 2 weeks of training and still said it wasn’t enough. how many days did you guys have? also, will it take a while for me to learn the drinks and be comfortable making em? how is working at dunkin in general? kind of nervous of customers possibly using colloquial terms to order things and me not understanding them. also how does the training look like, do i actually train in the store with real customers?",how is working at dunkin?
761,DunkinDonuts,"so evidently i'm in the minority, but i am in love with the irish creme flavor at dunks. i know it's a seasonal flavor and i don't know what i'll do when it's gone! i've tried the torani syrup version and just don't care for it, it's like, too sharp, if that explains it? i need the smoothness of the irish creme swirl! i usually get it with almond milk and don't need it super sweet or creamy. any recommendations for an at home solution?",obsessed with irish creme

as much as i appreciate the gesture ... i'm confused ! &amp; the order was made perfectly!

i thought maybe the person in front paid, but i feel like they would've mentioned that.

 it's a weird question, but i was just wondering what the difference is between three partial pumps (pump not depressed all the way) and three full pumps (pump pushed down all the way) of syrup in a medium iced coffee because when i order a medium, sometimes it has a little syrup, and sometimes it has considerably more. just curious if this has anything to do with how it's pumped.

771,DunkinDonuts,i’m just curious what dunkins policy is when it comes to the employees putting on the butter or cream cheese on bagels and muffins. it’s super inconsistent on which places will do it for you and which places won’t. literally on the menu there are two options for butter/cc which say on the food itself or on the side. but some stores will refuse to put the butter/cc on themselves and force the customer to do it which makes no sense because if i’m coming through a drive through asking for a muffin heated with butter why would i want to put it on myself? especially with a crappy plastic knife while i’m driving? so does it just come down to the laziness of the employee or do certain locations not allow their employees to put it on themselves? for example my girlfriend just got a muffin heated with butter and they told her they only put the butter on the side. even though it’s on the menu that you can order with butter on it. so i’m convinced since some places do it and some don’t it’s just laziness but wanted to know whether there was some sort of local franchise policy forbidding it.,putting butter/cream cheese on bagels/muffins

776,DunkinDonuts,"tl/dr: i'm an overwhelmed employee who used to really enjoy my job but now my work is draining me more and more and i feel torn. 

i'm getting to that point where i want to quit for real this time. i'm the main baker, and during the golden age of my employment as i call it (last spring/early summer) i really loved my job. i made a lot of friends and work didn't feel like work. 

but in the fall of last year, things got pretty blah and now things are just getting bad. we got bought out by a big company and they're making so many changes, like the dress code. we're even changing how the donut case is organized and specific kinds of donuts go into assorted dozens now, which led to us running out of blueberry at like 7am. and i love the way i organized my donuts and i don't want to be told what to do in the one thing where i felt like i had creative freedom... corporate obviously doesn't listen to what we feel is best and what works for our individual store. 

worst part, there's literally so much drama lately! i almost walked out today because my coworkers are like going at each other's throats. i'm going to feel bad if i end up leaving because i know how hard it is to find a baker. but this place has been sucking the life out of me for the past year and a half overall and i can't anymore. this isn't even to mention how the customers in the town that i work can be so mean and racist as well. we've had sandwiches thrown at us, direct threats, and some people have used terrible derogatory terms that i won't repeat here. all have been banned by our store, but similar people eventually take their place. the kind people get fewer and far between no matter how nice i am to them. all of it makes me dread coming in to work. 

i miss our old manager, but our newer manager is awesome and i know he's trying his best and he's doing well. i don't want to let him down. but i just can't do the drama anymore or the early mornings or people yelling at me. it's getting real bad for my mental health. i would be sad to leave but maybe it really is time.

that may seem sudden but on top of getting yelled at no matter how fast i got (average prep time for my kitchen job was 1 minute) getting told i’ll only be getting up to 12 hrs a week from next week onwards and having to wake up at 04:30 every morning i worked well i just couldn’t justify it.

i was only making $12.50 per hour so gas alone would cost more to come to and from then i would make. throw in my monthly bills so i wouldn’t be able to afford it. thus leading to me resigning this morning because sadly it was the more financially viable option. 

if it wasn’t for the low hours i’d still be working there and would of been working when i’m typing this but with my low pay and the fact id be spending more money in gas then i’d make in a pay period on top of the low hours and  pay less to me leaving. i also have bills to pay so spending more on gas then i’d make made the hours with such low pay even more unjustifiable.

for one of them, it seems to vary across their stores. almond milk used to be $0.50 across the board. but now only some of their stores have it at $0.50.

for their other stores, almond milk is $0.59 if it’s added to a drink, like a hot/iced coffee or cold brew with almond milk in it. and if a drink is made with almond milk, like a latte or cappuccino made with almond milk, they now charge $1.09 for it.

830,DunkinDonuts,"this happened a few days ago now, my recent new assistant manager was counting the drive thru draw when a customer had come to the speaker and she says to him “welcome to dunkin i’m in the middle of shift change i’ll be done in a hot minute” and he asked her what she meant by that, she answered him, let’s just say he didn’t ask her answer so he comes inside mad as hell! i make him his usual drink since he’s a regular, next thing i know he says he can’t stand the her first i thought he meant me but then he said “not you, i love you!” i felt my cheeks get so hot and i probably blushed also turning several shades of red! after i gave him his drink we talked for a few, then he left i immediately went straight for the walk-in cooler! he is very nice and respectful guy as well! he just really made me blush when he had said the loved me, it didn’t creep me out either!",my own 50 shades of grey story!
831,DunkinDonuts,"idk if any of you other dunkin hires experience this aswell but this happens on a daily basis

832,DunkinDonuts,"hi to anyone who works at dunkin , i just applied and i was wondering if dunkin allows anyone to work overtime? and if they have flexibility availability? please let me know!!!  thank you!",question 🙋🏻‍♀️
833,DunkinDonuts,"i know this was bad customer service &amp; i’m sorry. however, this lady pissed me off so bad i refused service to her. 

it was closing time, &amp; i was about to start counting the register. i mean come on.. it’s late, i’m tired, &amp; i’m just trying to go home. however, i let her order through the drive thru. (out of generosity).

she orders a medium hot matcha latte with mocha &amp; whipped cream. cool? right? so i repeat her order 2x. hell, my coworker heard me repeat it. i give her the latte &amp; she goes.. 

“there’s no mocha drizzle on the whipped cream”.  i’m like,

 “because you said add mocha into the matcha latte”

“no, i said add mocha in the latte”

“excatly… you said in the latte, not the mocha drizzle on top”

“no i said the mocha drizzle on top. i didn’t want mocha added inside”.

clearly she was on some type of drug. usually i let people get their way, but not today. i straight up told her that she said add mocha into the matcha latte, not on top. anyways, i remake the latte the way she wants it. i’m thinking i’m good right? wrong. as i’m walking away, she goes 

“um excuse me… i taste no mocha inside the latte”.

wtf dude.. now she wants it inside after she said… nevermind.

i remake the latte again, &amp; she goes on about how i’m ruined her night, &amp; how she’s gonna report me to the government. i truly didn’t give a damn. i shrugged my shoulders &amp; closed the window in her face.

about 5 minutes later, i hear something hit the window. she threw her drink on the window lol. i walk up to it, &amp; she’s yelling at me, demanding me to go make her a new stupid latte. i told her no?? i refused service &amp; i told her that we’re closed (we technically were) &amp; that i’d issue her refund. the whole time she’s screaming about how “poor” i am, &amp; how shes gonna report me to the government loool. i didn’t care. i gave her trash refund &amp; shut the window on her face again. i’m not remaking that gross ass latte. her taste buds are gross.

call me immature, idc. i’m not about to tolerate someone treating me bad because they can’t get their order right.",i was fed up.. lol (long rant)
834,DunkinDonuts,so i worked for dunkin for a few months and i told the manger that i would have to leave soon so i end up putting in my two weeks at one point but decide to be nice and stay for almost two extra months i eventually tell her okay i will leave now in two weeks but end up telling her i can’t finish the two weeks due to certain circumstances and now when i tried to go reapply my application is unapplicable!!!! this is not fair i was very loyal to them and dealt with so much crap and now i can never work for dunkin again! please tell me i can call corporate to have my application fixed.,unapplicable!!!???!!

900,DunkinDonuts,my dunkin has been undergoing some major changes with different personnel at the manager level. i worked an 8 am to 4 pm shift last weekend and the night after when i was closing i was told that i got a write up for taking a 10 minute break to eat a snack. the dunkin i work at has always had trouble and rarely keeps employees for more than 3 months at a time so they brought in a new district manager (i think that’s the right term) and he has cracked down on a lot of stuff but taking away breaks like that has to not be allowed right?  i understand for shorter shifts but for an 8 hour shift it seems unreasonable. i am leaving this job soon but was wondering what i could do to change this because i don’t want my coworkers to have to deal with no breaks.,no breaks for eight hour shift?

this may boil down to my misunderstanding what the actual difference is? like when i make iced coffee at home and i add 1 oz of half and half or milk to 10 oz of coffee, the entire drink turns that creamy light brown, wheras 2 times now my iced coffee + milk has been totally dark like nothing was added.  how much liquid measurement is being put in my drink when i am ordering 3 milks from dunkin, or have both orders been prepared wrong?","dinkin employee or customer, please help me understand difference between an iced latte vs an iced coffee with milk option?"

it does show the medium coffee’s cost as being deducted, but what confuses me is where it says ‘perks reward issue -200’.

912,DunkinDonuts,i was thinking about years ago when i first discovered what a tuna melt was. and how i was basically obsessed with that and paninis at the time. i used to ways go to delis and order a tuna melt on wheat bread with lettuce and tomatoes. but i think at that time i was also ordering a toasted croissant with tuna and cheese from dunkin a lot too. definitely was one of my favorite comfort foods of the past.,they used to serve tuna &amp; cheese on a croissant years ago right?

914,DunkinDonuts,"hi everyone, i've had a perplexing morning and was hoping to get some answers from the loyal fans of dd, 

full disclosure, i've never been to dunkin donuts before today. before i met my wife, i'd spent the majority of my life in a small town where your best bet for coffee drinks was mcdonald's (even that was only after they introduced the mccafe line-up). i'd heard of dd and seen some commercials, but never actually been to one myself. 

my wife and i currently live in a more populated area with tons of options for coffee (not joking, i didn't know what a macchiato was until i was 32), and today on my way home from work she asked me to stop in the dunkins drive-through. one iced coffee with 10 creams 4 sugars, and a side of mini hashbrowns. 

here's where it gets prickly, at the end, she mentioned she wanted an order of ""dumpy dunks"". when i asked her what those were she said they were similar to donut holes. when i pulled up to the drive-through window to place the order, everything went smooth until i couldn't find ""dumpy dunks"" anywhere on the menu. i asked the person taking my order if they had been discontinued and after a while of pausing he said he didn't remember that product ever being sold in store (he also mentioned that he was new). for the next 5 minutes, i waited as he asked different employees in the store if they had ever sold ""dumpy dunks"", all of which said no. 

is it possible this item was regional? or did i just get pranked by my wife?","new to dunkins, might have gotten pranked by my wife"
915,DunkinDonuts,lately just been getting my iced drinks with just almond milk and realizing it's actually good just like that. might get like some cold foam or a pump of this just for a certain flavor. i could never be a plain coffee drinker with nothing else added. i've tried that many times and failed to like it. but as someone that eats a lot of sugary snacks every day i try to cut back on sugar when i can. i don't get people that get a sweet shot and then add real sugar on top of that just seems crazy.,sometimes you don't need any added sugar at all
916,DunkinDonuts,"i went to three different local dunkin's the other day. one of them only had chocolate and glazed. the other had chocolate + glazed + jelly. i asked this place why they don't have powdered / cinnamon and they said that they only order what sells the best. now of course they would know more than me but i find it hard to believe powdered munchkins don't sell.

the last place i went to told me that they do order p/c munchkins but there's currently a sugar shortage so they haven't been sending them over. is there any truth to this?",what's going on with powdered / cinnamon munchkins?

920,DunkinDonuts,"so it seems like four out of five times that i ask for flavor shots instead of swirls (which is always), i get my cup and look at the tag on the side to see ""swirls"" listed despite asking for shots. this is at multiple different dunkins throughout the state. i am on a very low-sugar diet, so it's basically a wasted coffee for me at that point unless i inevitably give it to someone else. however, what boggled my mind was a few hours ago when this happened to me i made my order (iced coffee, stevia, oat milk, 4 french vanilla flavor shots) and was asked to confirm if i meant ""unsweetened french vanilla"".   


i was under the impression that all of the flavor shots were ""unsweetened"" so i said yes. couldn't go wrong that way, right? got my coffee and it had 4 swirls listed on the tag.  


am i doing something wrong in ordering? is it possible that they actually are flavor shots but are simply misprinted on the tag (i ask this because i've had family taste-test my coffee and say that it tastes too bland/not sweet enough to be full of swirls). just wondering if i'm the only one running into this issue.",always seem to get swirls instead of shots?
921,DunkinDonuts,"why is this important to know? because i’ve noticed a lot of posts in this sub questioning why their dunks has different rules/policies/procedures/deals etcetera. it’s because many locations are franchises and have different owners who set their own rules. some places can take tips, some can’t. some managers have to do refunds, some don’t. please, as a former employee, stop using the “they do it for me at x dunkins” because honestly we don’t care what they do for you at another store we have to follow the rules of our location and if we cant give you something because our jobs are at stake,  people take it out on the employees. it’s just something to remember. similar to many fast food places. franchises run the majority so uniformity will not be identical between stores. things like quality obviously should be identical but dunkins and many other places have struggled during this pandemic and training for new employees is basically nothing. they’re thrown on the floor and told to start working day 1 or day 2, i’ve seen it. if a mistake happens just be polite about it. and remember different franchises have different policies. thanks for coming to my tedtalk",psa: dunkins has many franchises!

wtf is going on. i randomly go to a different location to see if has gotten better but it hasn't. even the hashbrowns have that taste. is it the way the oven is cleaned? upper management? or is it the employees trying to encourage us customers to not order food? i've worked for fast food before and have seen this happen for certain items on the menu, typically theyd just make it gross with more toppings than usual. but i've never experienced fast food that has a chemical taste to it.",commonwealth stores of ma

with [the news](https://i.imgur.com/xkxeit6.jpg) that the dunkaccino is being eliminated, i'm understandably crushed. so someone said to me, ""maybe you can find a local store that's going to get rid of the machine and ask if you can have or buy it.""

the employee i normally see behind the counter noticed a plain black iced coffee was ordered and asked me about it. i told her that i just wanted the one iced coffee and i would just contact cs later for a refund. she offered to give me a coffee tomorrow on her next shift. unfortunately, i won’t be able to stop by and told her i will just contact customer service and ask for a refund. no problems at all as i had to contact before due to a compromised gift card and an oat milk up charge on a mobile order when they were out. they have always been extremely helpful. 

i just got off the phone with customer service and they said that the franchise owner would be reaching out within the next two days. will they be able to refund me for the black iced coffee? i am not sure if they have that power. any assistance in the past from dunkin customer service has been handled just with them.",customer service question

988,DunkinDonuts,"two parts to this rant:

1) i am the closing shift lead at my store, and tonight i was closing with our newest hire (i've only closed w them twice). they had to leave at 7:00 (when our store closes) because they had another engagement to attend that night, and as long as the store is closed well, i'm super chill w my workers, so i told them that if we buckled down and really got to work we could probably get out at 7:00. i started assigning them a few tasks, and got to work on tasks that i think take the longest and rarely get done well (i.e. dishes, restocking/cleaning sandwich, cleaning taps, mopping). however, when i checked in on the other closer, they had taken off their headset and were making tiktoks. frequently throughout the night, they were taking 30 min bathroom breaks, making tiktoks, or just standing around. they refused to put their headset back on, leaving me to take orders, make food and drinks, and do the closing tasks myself. when they took out the trash, a bag split open. they came in and told me, so i told them that if there was plastic and shit everywhere they should sweep it up. they got upset and said ""fine, i guess ill go sweep the street."" they left with a broom, but after we finished closing and were walking to our cars i saw with my own eyes that they had not swept it up as there was still plastic and shit everywhere. i couldnt even clean it up because the store was locked. on top of all of that, when i asked them to finish up dishes, they looked at me angry and asked what i was going to do. as if im not the shift lead. as if i hadnt done the majority of the close by myself. anyways. im not the confrontational type, but if tomorrow wasnt my last day i wouldve become the confrontational type. 

2) my store is completely short staffed and has been since i started. however, the whole store is falling apart now. my manager, assistant manager, and the other shift lead along with about 3-4 other employees are all quitting. tomorrow is my last day. there will only be abt 3 ppl on staff after this week. our dunkin upper management has been awful to us. forcing us to cut hours for everyone, having maybe two ppl on the clock while having our lobby and drive thru open, overworking salary employees with no compensation. everyone is fed up. our store is falling apart. 

tl;dr: (1) had to close basically by myself bc the other closer was making tiktoks. (2) our store is probably gonna close bc we're all quitting",gen rant?
989,DunkinDonuts,"i wanted to know… if i get the dunkin’ app as an employee can i scan my loyalty id for customers who don’t use their own id’s? i work tomorrow and i might ask my shift leader if i’m allowed to do that but incase i might get in trouble, i wanna know if i’d be able to just stack up infinite points for scanning my own loyalty id. and then use the points for free stuff, without actually spending any money…",possibly a chance for forever free dunkin’???

1012,DunkinDonuts,"before i start, i want to say that i have worked on valentines day before. while not at dunkin, i worked at a flower shop that is a big staple of my city, so i know the rush that popular stores get on this day firsthand

i’ve only experienced one holiday at dunkin so far and it was thanksgiving. thanksgiving as a holiday was one i didn’t expect to be so pressuring, we had a line around the store and inside the lobby with the drink tickets nearly hitting the floor at some points. it was an extremely stressful and pressuring day that lead me to have at least 2 breakdowns due to the fast-paced environment my brain couldn’t keep up with.

my coworkers have already warned me about valentines day, they say its awful, and i can only imagine it both from personal experience and then comparing that with how thanksgiving was, i don’t think i would be emotionally prepared to handle it. 

i’d like to take off both to keep myself out of pressure and for my own stress not to put more pressure on my coworkers who witness me break from the weight. i’ve already put in the request form but have gotten no reply or such yet. my main fear is that my coworkers will see me as lazy or unreliable for bailing on them on such a busy holiday but a part of me says i’d rather them be mad at me for that than have them deal with my mental state taking such a hit by trying to keep a pace i may not be able to, even if ive taken my medication.",is it wrong for me to request off for valentines day?

1019,DunkinDonuts,"i want to begin this post by reminding everyone that it is illegal for your employer to retaliate against you for discussing your wages, and if they do so, sue the pants off of them.

at my dunkin, i make $14.50/hour. the state minimum wage is $14.25. we get a raise every new year, when the state increases the minimum wage, and that’s it. the openers, closers, and shift leaders all make the same amount ($14.50) as well. 

when covid first hit, we had $2 added on to our check for every hour we worked (so if you worked 20 hours, $40 would be added to your check, not an extra $2/hour. apparently we’re not worth that much even during a global pandemic). last year, in i believe november, they added an extra $1/hour raise to our pay that was supposed to be permanent as well (minimum wage then was $13.50/hour, so we were making $14.50/hour). that was the last raise we saw.

the pay is really insulting, especially with basically no benefits. we can get health insurance thru dunkin at my location, but it is very expensive and covers jack shit. next door at mcdonald’s, they get $17/hour with tuition coverage, and other benefits as well as better pay. the other 2 stores i work next to also pay about ~$17/hour. why shouldn’t my coworkers and i all quit and work there? even other franchises offer better benefits. in the next town over from mine, there is a franchise that will pay your tuition. and for having to get food out the drive thru window in 150 seconds or less, it’s ridiculously low.

i also don’t count tips in this, as some stores make worse tips and some shifts also have worse tips than others, and they really should be paying us more anyway. it’s not like they don’t have the money.

just some thoughts though.",how much do you get paid at your dunkin? (not including tips)
1020,DunkinDonuts,"every time cold cup designs change i assume a given store has an unused pile to deal with... are they just tossed, always sent to recycling, or varies by store and/or franchisee?

1029,DunkinDonuts,"to start - in case this is regional - i live in central virginia.   the three stores near me have decals on the windows saying something like dd perk members - free medium or hot on wednesdays.  i went to a store last wednesday and ordered a medium iced.  i showed my app at the drive thru and it deducted the full price from my gift card.  i then asked for a receipt and it showed i paid for the coffee.  i then told the worker it was supposed to be free.  he said he did not know of any promo.  he then asked the manager and she said she knew about the sign but if the register did not take it off as free there is nothing she can do.  she said it did not show as free in “offers” section of the app and i should only count on it as a promo if it shows in the offers section.  

i contacted dd customer service through the app and they gave me a free beverage coupon to even in out.

i had a terrible experience today on my way to work.   ordered a black pepper bacon sandwich, but charged for a  maple sugar bacon sandwich, then when i get to work and take out my sandwich, it is just some bacon on a crossoint, no egg.

the phone number goes straight to voice-mail, then tells me the mailbox is full so i have to drive back after work.

the doors are locked(i know, pandemic) so i have to go back thru the drive thru.  finally able explain what happened and am told no refunds, but they will give the correct sandwich.  i ordered the sandwich for breakfast 6 hours earlier, it does me nothing to finally get it now nor does it address my wasted time.


so i am asking, do you guys really refuse refunds when you mess up someone's order?  or am i dealing with a poorly run franchise?

before i explain my story, please note that i am not a lazy person, i am extremely active and exercise as much as a i can. i was actually pretty thin a decade ago.

when i started working third shift, i became addicted to coffee (which sounds like it'd be obvious lol).  my town had just been introduced to dunkin's iced coffees (keep in mind this was 14 years ago).  i would get a coffee every so often, then it turned into every day.  i can honestly say for the last 10 years, i've had at least one iced coffee a day from dunkin donuts. and also for the last 10 years, i've struggled losing weight no matter how hard i worked out.  i've been checked by my doctor for various things, nothing shows as to why i cannot lose the weight.

my boyfriend (who has always been rail thin) just recently started drinking a lot of dunkin and starbucks and now he has a little belly on him.  i am starting to put two and two together here.

today, i am quitting my dunkin habit. i know it'll be hard but i feel i need to do it. my body is suffering because of a daily coffee routine i became addicted to.

1105,DunkinDonuts,"just came back from my local dunks not long ago, and noticed something odd about the everything stuffed bagel minis. when i bit into one the filling was different, and so was the topping. i think the filling was still cream cheese but had green flecks in it and kinda tasted similar to spinach artichoke dip.

1107,DunkinDonuts,"sooo, the title kinda says it all. everytime i order a hot chai latte from dd, it tastes really sour....not pleasant at all. initially i thought maybe the milk had gone bad, so i threw it out. didn't order another for a month or so. then, it happened again. same sour taste. i started wondering if they'd used a milk substitute, but that didn't add up b/c i regularly drink almond, oat, coconut milks &amp; they never have that taste. the next one i ordered, i specifically asked for almond milk, &amp; this one was some better, bit i could still taste that sourness. gave up on them for about four months, but today i was craving a chai latte &amp; had already gone by jittery joe's (which have the best chai lattes). so dummy me ordered...you guessed it, a medium hot chai latte. aaaand it was sour! what gives?? has anyone experienced this?",chai latte...strange taste
1108,DunkinDonuts,"i got home last night and decided to save my coffee from tmr, i was annoyed they gave me 1 caramel swirl and 1 cream for my large that's obviously not the standard and i was gonna have to add stuff to it myself... well it's tomorrow i pour my coffee into a new cup and three black beads fall into the cup! and they were decently big! like how do you miss that. did your bracelets break and it not make a splash?

i really just suck up their mistakes. when my mini bagels are frozen solid i throw them in my microwave. when my coffee or tea is messed up i fix it at home. when they give me the wrong donuts i just it. when they forget to give me a whole item i'll just nicely go in and ask for it. i don't want to bother them they only get paid minimum wage. but to have beads in my coffee?? i think i gotta draw the line somewhere. so i call them. i explain that there were bracelet beads in my coffee. and they person says ""uh"" the hangs up on me!! ugh i can't even i'm so done with this location idec if it's the closet one with a drive through, i'm never going to it again!",ugh the dunkin closest to me is absolutely atrocious not only do they always mess orders up (from giving frozen solid mini bagels to simply messing up coffees) there three bracelets beads in my coffee!

1110,DunkinDonuts,"so when i go to dunkin and order just one donut, every now and then the person gives me extra donuts. i understand if they do it at night and don't want it to go to waste, but sometimes it happens in the morning too. are they doing it out of kindness? am i supposed to say an extra thanks? am i supposed to pretend like they didn't do it? one time i ordered 1 boston creme donut and they gave 4! it was at 10am. then i realized the person probably saw the 4 from the 4 caramels from my large drink and thought the donut was also 4 instead of 1.  but one day i ordered 1 and they gave 2. and it's not like they see me as a regular or anything. just wondering if others have same experience.",giving extra donuts

dunkin was always too watered down for me years ago. it didn't have a good rep with me in regards to coffee. eventually i stopped drinking starbucks years ago. 

but recently i've been getting a latte here and there, comparing them to dunkin's lattes. and i prefer the taste of dunkin. the flavoring is better. the espresso isn't as bitter as starbucks. starbucks has been hit or miss for me.

1133,DunkinDonuts,"if you remember my post talking about my struggle getting off a month ago, you may also remember me mentioning i don’t make tips. a lot of you were wondering why so i basically  discreetly asked my coworkers

the main reasoning for it is stuff along the lines of “trainees don’t know what they’re doing so why should they make tips off a job they don’t know how to do correctly”. 

they keep reassuring me that i’ll “get there soon enough” though it will be another 2-3 months before my “tip test” which my franchise owner uses to certify that i know how to do my job and am eligible to make tips because of that. even if tips arent a lot i gotta say it sucks being given a nice tip from a customer and knowing i won’t be seeing any of it",the reasoning for not making tips

1137,DunkinDonuts,"im still working at dunkin, obviously. recently i got switched from drinks to order taking/window because i have a naturally pleasant voice, which my franchise owner really liked.

whenever its very slow (to the point of no cars and no tickets) i usually draw on the back of leftover receipts people don’t want when i cash them out. im an artist and it also acts as a stimulation for me and keeps me grounded. sometimes i may doodle while we get a bit of business too, but i put my order taking duties before my art.

however, we’ve also got cameras and one faces right into the drive thru area. one of the shift leaders has been watching the cameras from her home (word of mouth suggests that she can see them on her phone or computer) and she doesn’t like the routine i give myself. so for the past weeks ive found that my drawings have now been getting thrown away when i walk away from the drive thru area to get a donut/munchkins, or that the pens im using seem to always be in use by someone else. 

however, the yesterday and today i’ve found that my coworkers have started taking the pens (as seen by me finding one of them hiding the pen i just used in their pocket), and me coming in and all the pens suddenly being taken off the drive-thru area to restrict me from doing so.

my coworkers have never really minded my artistic habits, in fact they like seeing my art from time to time. even though i prioritize my work, it sucks to see that they would go as far as to hide pens from me.",day 40-something: they’ve started hiding the pens from me.

i mean dunkin donuts rush hour, to put it bluntly, is fucking insane, on like my second day at working at dunkin i was expected to make like 10 drinks in 3 minutes. its absolutely ludicrous and me being a new hire imagine trying to ask questions regarding things during rush hour. shits absolutely mad and honestly quite stressful.

im not planning on quitting right and i want to give it time to see if it becomes easier but holy crap man. dunkin donuts probably has one of the craziets rush hours i've ever seen at a fast food place.

1163,DunkinDonuts,"can anyone please explain why dunkin donuts changed their coffee lids from the old fashioned design where the lid plug was integrated in the lid and now the newer style has the open mouthpiece with the separate plastic dipstick? this design sucks for a few reasons…
• this change took place around covid starting. why would you want to incorporate a separate plastic piece that must be handled by the employee before it goes into your drink? i’ve seen the bins they are kept in behind the counter. not sanitary and the employee touches multiple sticks each time they reach for one.
• it is inconvenient when you just want to reach for your drink with one hand but now have a dipstick to pull out first.
• when you remove the dipstick you sometimes have to put it down somewhere if you plan on taking multiple sips before replugging. now you are potentially introducing the stick to more germs when placing it down.
• wouldn’t it cost more money for this design since you are now bringing in additional inventory at each location? 
• isn’t this adding to waste and impacting the environment that you market yourself caring about?
• i don’t enjoy getting to the bottom of my cup and finding the shaft of a broken stick because the employee grabbed one without a head and dropped it in. yes this happened to me today. luckily i didn’t swallow it and choke.",coffee cup lid change

1173,DunkinDonuts,"if you work at my location and see this post, no you didnt.

to run some things by off the bat, i'm 19, this is my second job, and i have autism, adhd, and anxiety. all of these i try not to have hinder my work while on on the clock, but sometimes events get the best of me.

today a woman, her relative/friend, and a young boy approached the register. the woman's friend/relative ordered for her, she said 3 blueberry donuts and a coffee roll. i repeated this back to her and she confirmed it. i cashed her out, gave her change, the whole one two. i'm already a few hours into my shift and its a rush hour so i'm a bit tired, annoyed, and very slightly overwhelmed.

i grab a bag for the donuts. she says she wants a box. annoying ok sure. i grab a box for 6 donuts and start putting them in there. no, thats the wrong box. at this point i had barely known about muffin boxes, so i was confused on what other box there was. my coworker grabs a muffin box. ok cool.

i put the donuts in the box. at this point shes now questioning why im giving her donuts, and tells me she ordered *muffins.* while its a common mistake especially when my hearings fucked from wearing a headset all day, it was tipping me off my mental edge. i knew if i didn't go to the back and take a breather i would snap *at* her. my emotions were already tipping, so i turn around towards the back and just go ""ineedaminuteineedaminutepleasegivemeaminute"" *(repeating sentences when im stressed is a mental response of mine, though i'm not sure what its fully linked to its usually based on people not listening to me the first time)* and when i did come back out after letting some of my anger/stress out, the womans at the counter pointing and screaming at me.

i couldn't hear what she was saying fully, but the jist of it was shit like im disrespectful, i was yelling at her, etc. and my coworkers told me to just ignore her, meaning i couldnt even explain myself / tell her that i was never *intending* to yell at her. and once she left my coworkers basically took a side with her, saying that i was being disrespectful to her and even if i didn't snap at her like i almost did, if my franchise owner saw the video they would insist the customer would be right. 

it's annoying. the customer is always right. that i don't have the chance or right to defend something i did that was taken the wrong way. i don't *want* or *like* to get overwhelmed like that, and no matter how hard i try to keep it from does happening, when it does im still seen as wrong, or annoying, or hard to work with.","""the customer is always right"" annoyance (rant/vent)"
1174,DunkinDonuts,"alright, i’m a future shift leader at my store and while we could use 1 or 2 more morning people, we have a decent crew and we definitely aren’t understaffed. no one is currently brand new besides a girl training for overnights 


i’ve worked every shift and have about 2 years total experience at dd- i’m not sure how long it’s been since my store had tried to make time as i actually came back about a month and a half ago now and i was overnights until these past two weeks! 

i want to try and. push my crew to start making time, but most of them started when our store was a “just please be here and make coffee and take peoples money” rather than being efficient and trying to keep the 80% and up. 

my manager asked me to make a list of pointers to share with other shift leaders and her as kind of focal points based off of what i had seen, and this is what i have so far

	⁃	if you are not busy with customers and you see someone needs help , help- especially drive they, drive thru is priority 
	⁃	everyone should be listening for orders to help the ot
	⁃	if the ot is busy and you arent, try to jump in and help take orders or run donuts to drive thru
	⁃	keep things stocked, if you can’t get off of your station then ask someone who iant busy to grab something for you
	⁃	be efficient, ot should be starting espresso shots for coffees so they are done and the drinks are done faster
	⁃	ot should be setting up orders for the window, they should be seeing the next order and making sure everything is ready for hand out
	⁃	sandwich station always should have batches of hash browns, snackin bacon, eggs bacon maple bacon and sausage
	⁃	when not busy sandwich station should stock and fill bagels in the station as well as make sure everything is filled like cheese snd meats and other breads
	⁃	coffees should be making multiple drinks at a time, never one at a time unless there is only one drink to make
	⁃	ot should be putting orders in quickly and repeating orders as you go to ensure complete accuracy, be personable and make them feel like you want them there! 
	⁃	drive thru if you need help, say you need help whether it’s sandwiches coffees or something else
	

soooo, what other ideas do you guys have for pushing my crew to start making time? i know some of you will find this post dumb, but i really want to make my store fast again. we used to have an amazing crew who would make time most days of the week and i think we can get there again with our current group!",tips for making time with newer crew?

my husband has been drinking 1-3 large iced coffees a day for literally decades and recently, he has complained the smell seems different. then he started really feeling ill after drinking it and even vomited once. 

he’s had to give it up for now (i’m  making him hot tea at home before he leaves for work and he’s making the same for himself while on the job site) and i’ve been giving him some acid reducing meds and it’s really helped. he hasn’t had a problem since he gave it up. 

he’s jonesing to go back to the iced coffee but i’m 100% against it. has the quality of the beans gone down? is this an issue that could be in one store but not others or do all dunkin franchises use the exact same coffee beans?

1208,DunkinDonuts,"my sister just recently started working at dunkins about late september to maybe early october in gales ferry, connecticut from 6am-10am. she loved her job at the store she worked at by as of late november, she was transferred to a gas station/dunkins in groton, connecticut where she'd be working 12pm-5pm. now here comes the real story...and i'm sure i'm not even supposed to post this here but i am so pissed off it's not even funny and i will spread this where ever i need too in order for dunkins to see it and feel the fucking heat because dunkins has removed my facebook post and my twitter post from their page. my sister is 18 years old, has high functioning autism and high anxiety. she applied to dunkins as a way to help support the household since her father passed away in august, she was happy at the gales ferry one; she loved the manager there, she loved her co-workers, and as much as she hated being transferred...she dealt with it. she was there for all of 2, maybe 3 days, before that store manager tells her ""you're closing tomorrow."" on her way out. my sister was scared, she was never trained to close dunkins and assumed someone would be with her the next day...she was wrong. she was given tasks/assignments that she had literally no idea how to do because she wasn't trained in closing the store...she was always out of work by 5:05pm at the latest while someone else closed.  


we had no idea about the no training and also assumed someone would be there with her. i went into the gas station to let her know her ride was there but to also get something to drink and snack on from the gas station only to see my sister on her own, almost in tears because she was so stressed and her anxiety was through the roof. she was alone and as much as the henny penny employee wanted to help her, she couldn't in fear of getting in trouble. so i hung around the gas station, which the henny penny employee was okay with, and watched as my sister struggled to do her tasks. she was supposed to be at 5:00pm and she assumed she'd be there for maybe an extra 30 minutes closing but she was there till about 7:45pm. the manager watching her from home on the cameras and speaking to my sister like she was a fucking idiot on the phone. the management basically threw my sister to the wolves expecting her to know how to do everything. oh but here's the kicker...you all know we gotta wear masks everywhere right? whether you support them or not, you know we gotta wear them cause of covid. well my sister has a low immune system due a livery and kidney issue and our mom has a very low immune system due to 2 autoimmune diseases and she went into work on the first day and wore her mask for about an hour, she went outside to get some fresh air real quick when the manger of that store went after her and told her not to wear her mask because ""it looked unprofessional."" and when my sister tired to fight it, telling them why she needed the mask...they threatened to let her go and in fear of loosing her job, she complied. nobody should be afraid to loose their job because they want to protect them themselves and their loved ones by wearing a fucking mask.

so the next day, december 3 2021, my sister called that store manager and told her she was done. she couldn't handle being left alone and that she was more a team player than a solo player, which that manager rudely remarked ""made no sense"" and hung up on her. on december 4th, my sister messaged the overall manager, i'm not sure which kind of manager she is but she's the one who hired her and she manages multiple groton, ct stores and explained the situation and how she wasn't given any training on how to close, to which the woman rudely remarked was ridiculous, she had two or three months worth of training and it was stupid of my sister to even claim that before saying 'your checks should be available on friday""....excuse me? should?! then she ends it with ""no response necessary"" when my sister was telling her sorry for wasting her time, thanks for the opportunity, and which store was she supposed to pick up her check at? the manager never answered her and if we had to guess, she blocked the number.

my family (specifically my father's side) has a vacation planned for after christmas. not long, from the 28th to the 2nd, so i'd really only be gone 4 days or so. it's 2 hours away, and i can't drive by myself yet (i am over 18 and have a permit). so not only would i want to drive myself to and from my job for 2 hours each, but i don't want anyone else going through the same. 

november 16th. 9 days before thanksgiving i go to request those days off. not even a month before christmas, not even a month before new years, and my workplace has a notice up that they're not accepting any requests off for christmas eve, new years, or new years day. considering i was still in training i didn't even have time to learn how to request off, and now i was smacked in the face with there's not a chance i can get off.

my coworkers noticed my panic, and they agreed with me, it's not fair, i had literally no opportunity to request off. i still filled out a forum anyways and did specify that it was a preplanned thing. however i still get the feeling my shift leader is trying to schedule me for the days i specifically said i would be away (especially since i saw my name in with a list of peoples for that day). 

i plan on going anyways. i fear i may get written up so many times that i'm suspended or fired, but i'd rather be with my family, especially since i don't even get paid my dues yet since i can't make tips for another 2 or 3 months (if i pass my tip test the first time)",the pain of getting days off

“welcome to dunkin, what can i get for you”

c- “hi, i ordered through the app?”

“oh okay, what’s the name?”

c- “*some name* ?”

*checks the to-go drink stickers, can’t find it*

“i’m sorry, we don’t have it- are you sure your order went through?”

c- “yeah it’s going through now :)”

hunters/landscapers/outdoor blue collar workers: usually smoke a ton and are desensitized to sugar. “extra large 9 and 10” is not uncommon. nuts.*

homeschoolers: someone way too old to be going into a dunkin with their mother. both order hot chocolate or matcha.

1235,DunkinDonuts,"sorry about formatting and misspellings, bad story telling etc. 


today was nearly my breaking point. i got in at 5am. we’re severely understaffed especially for our location (highway) new person didnt show up and another called 30 minutes after his shift was meant to start saying he was going to be late because of traffic, only to call in again another 30 minutes later saying he wasnt coming in. i got told i had to stay until 2pm. a 9 hour shift. 

it was extremely busy from 6am to 12pm. the owner refuses to buy us enough supplies to last the week. so we were out of milk, skim milk, sugar, and the ice machine is broken. 

theres 5 of us. one is new. its so deeply stressful the whole time. trying to calm customers down when we say theres no sugar. 

all the 12 oclock people leave. 12 oclock people show up. its me and two others. we get a line wrapped around the building. 

a lady starts ordering. this is basically how it goes. 

lady: i want a large frozen coffee with caramel coconut and mocha

coworker: large frozen coffee with caramel, coconut and mocha?

lady: no! i said a large frozen with caramel

coworker: so no coconut or mocha flavoring?

lady: a large frozen coffee. coconut. and mocha. 

coworker: ok, so its a large frozen coffee, with coconut flavoring, and mocha

lady: *loud sigh* i said caramel 

coworker: large coconut, caramel, and mocha?

lady: yes finally you get it right. jesus. 

and she pulls away from the speaker before we can say anything. we are completely confused after she kept changing it and raising her voice. 

she gets to the window, gets her drink and we move on to the next customer. a second later shes still sitting at the window and snapping at us to get out attention. she says her drink is wrong. i read out what was rung up on the register to her. she complains that her coffee is “grainy” aka: has ice in it. because its a  frozen coffee. so it has shaved ice bits. she says her coffee is never this texture and i try to explain that a frozen coffee is always that texture, or it should be. she raised her voice and repeats her drink to me, differently then she ordered it,  before yelling that shes been waiting too long and just wants her money back. we arent able to do refunds because only the manager is capable of doing that. not that we arent allowed to, but we dont have the option to on the register. 

im at my breaking point. the whole day has been more stressful than any other day here, and ive been working at this location for almost a year. im about to start crying. i quickly tell a coworker she wants her money back so i can step away from the window. 

coworker starts talking to her and trys to explain the situation. she continues yelling at us. claiming she comes here all the time and her drink is never like this. i work 6 days a week. ive never seen her. i dont even know what happened next but suddenly she was gona dn the next car pulled up. now theyve been waiting forever because this lady had to yell at us for making her frozen coffee the way she ordered it. 

the first thing out of this next persons mouth is an exacerbated “why is this taking so long. are you guys understaffed or something?!” i almost collapsed to the floor crying. 

like dude, you heard this lady yelling at us, you know it took so long because she wanted to yell at us. why do you also have to act like this. 

the rest of the line went like this. when the line was finally gone a guy came inside. say my mask and went “why are you wearing a mask. studies show they dont work you should report your employer”

my brain just,,,, i couldnt respond. i just lied. said it was required, its not. i just want to keep wearing my mask. i work with food, and chemicals to clean things. i like my mask. i like not breathing on peoples food. not breathing in (as much) chemicals. i just didnt have the mental capacity to respond properly. i knew he was gonna argue with me no matter what i said. i just politely took his order.

1283,DunkinDonuts,"i’ve been getting iced coffee and cold brew at dunkin’ for many years now and i have not once thought of getting an americano with a flavor shot or swirl. does anyone do this themselves, or if you work there, do you get customers who add flavors to their americano? what about cold foam?",flavor shots with iced americano
1284,DunkinDonuts,"dunkin donuts basically hired me (they took ssn) but never gave me a starting date, when i reach out to the manager they say having a problem with e-verify, it's been almost a month now!

anyone's to whom this happened?",dunkin hired me but never called back!!!
1285,DunkinDonuts,"i've been going to the dunkin near my house pretty much every day for 2 years.  i get the same thing every morning before work:  a large energy cold brew.  the employees usually finish my sentence before i even get halfway through my order.  as far as i know, i have a good employee/customer relationship with everyone there.   this morning, i was told i could not order it in large anymore.  just small.  i asked why because maybe i could order it a little differently so i could get it in a large.  she said that it's because ""the foam doesn't rise to the top in a large.""  

......what?  what foam?  i tried asking just that, but was told i was holding up the line and to either order a small or get something else.

so, i drove to the dunkin that's a little past my work, 10 miles away from the one by my house.  i was able to order a large there.  i told the lady there about my experience at the other store and she said she had no idea why the other store said that and that it's ""simply not true about the foam.""

it's really convenient to grab my coffee at the dunkin near my house. especially on the weekends when i'm not going to be anywhere near my work.   i'd hate to not be able to go there anymore.  or, have to order two small cold brews?  or, yikes, go to starbucks.   i know, first world problem, right?  :p any insight as to my options at this point, though?",no more large cold brew?
1286,DunkinDonuts,do the franchise owners not realize that the drive-thru driveway needs to be longer than 25 feet?  *every single location* that i have to pass by is spilling into the road and blocking traffic in both directions.,dunkin has become the bane of my morning commute
1287,DunkinDonuts,"was i in the wrong here?? i think i might have been rude but i have never experienced anything like this at dunkin ever. i’ve always had good service. 

i went to dunkin the other day and got an avocado toast and a vanilla cold brew with sweet cream. the interaction went like this. 

me: “hi i want an avocado toast…..”

worker: “do you want bacon on it?”

me: “no just regular. no bacon. and i also want a large vanilla cold brew with sweet cold foam.” 

worker: “okay avocado toast and a cold brew with sweet cream. anything else?”

me: “that’s it but i do want vanilla in the cold brew.” 

worker: “ohh okay i didn’t get that. sorry about that. anything else?”

me: “no that’s all. thank you.”

get up to the window. i pay and hands me two separate cold brews one with sweet cream and one with vanilla. i clarify that i just wanted one cold brew with both sweet cream and vanilla. he says “okay i’ll just put sweet cream in the vanilla one. keep the other.” i said “okay that works. she probably just misunderstood me. no problem.”

maybe 10-20 seconds pass. he asks if i’n waiting on food. i say yes i had one avocado toast. “she didn’t ring it up.” and this is where i start getting aggravated. so i just sit there for a second say “uh okay”. he just stands there so then i say “well i asked for it at the speaker. i distinctly remember her asking me if i want bacon on it. so i would like the avocado toast that i asked for.”

he looks again: “well it’s not on here.”

me: “well that’s not really my problem i don’t think???” at this point i’m confused, hungry, and annoyed and just want my toast and i don’t know why he’s arguing with me.

“well i can’t just let you have it for free.” that’s not what i was after but keep in mind that i just paid for a stupid cold brew that i didn’t want and didn’t drink. but this didn’t cross my mind until after.

“i’ll pay for it i don’t care about that. i just want what i asked for.” i paid for the toast and pulled up to the front of the store and finally got my toast but the whole thing was just odd not to mention i ended up overpaying for things i didn’t ask for and left with a sour taste in my mouth. i felt like a karen but i genuinely don’t know how else i could’ve handled it.",bad dunkin experience. was i wrong here?

1289,DunkinDonuts,"bro. i clocked in this morning to my friend telling me that the card reader at the drive thru wasn't working at all and that we had to cash out customers using our only working pos register at the front. great. not only that, my friend, being the shift lead, had to call customer support and to no avail. he wasn't able to get it up and running. i ended up giving people free shit because it was already so much of a hassle to just try and figure out what went fucking wrong in the process of making a drive-thru order transfer to the front register when it was already being used. oh yeah and to top it all off, we ran out of fucking creamer, my friend had to go buy creamer with his own money (god bless his soul) and the other shift lead didn't help me when i was juggling drive-thru, food station, and window when my friend eventually had to clock out!!!!!! i was left with 3 other coworkers who haven't been trained on anything else but drinks and i couldn't just train them to do dt because we were swamped!!!!!! ugh. i'm hoping tomorrow is better.",what a terrible day.

1294,DunkinDonuts,"the other morning i placed my usual mobile order. i arrive at the location i go to every day, and they tell me they didn’t get an order from me. i look at the app, turns out i forgot to switch the location back to my regular spot after i ordered somewhere else the previous afternoon. 

as dumb as it sounds, i was ready to cry lol. i’ve been having a tough time lately, i was already late for work, and this was just the cherry on top of the crap sundae. 

the manager immediately steps forward and says “you come here every day honey, tell me what you ordered and we’ll make it for you for free.”

i’m sure the folks working that day didn’t realize how much of a difference they made, but such a small act of kindness meant so much to me. i tipped of course but i wish there was more i could do to show my gratitude.

1295,DunkinDonuts,"today was really busy and we closed today at 2:00 for a remodel, so we were low on supplies/drinks. including caramel swirl, cold brew, small hot cups, munchkins, hashbrowns, and more.

the first mistake was when a guy asked for hashbrowns and i said sorry we don’t have that. then he asked if we have cold brew and i said “no i’m sorry” while sort of chuckling since i thought it was kinda funny how i just kept saying no. then he said, “i mean it’s not funny and here you are smiling, really?” he said and rolled his eyes.


the second mistake was far worse. i was given a hot coffee by an employee and i capped it, noticing it was slightly indented at the bottom but i brushed it off. then i capped on the lid and made sure it was on, but when i gave it to him it popped off and the hot coffee burned both our fingers. he and his wife yelled “fuck!” and he looked mad. i was shocked and said “omg i’m so sorry are you ok” and he shrugged. i couldn’t explain the feeling in my stomach after that happened 

i’ve worked for 3 months too and an employee who was assigned to work here laughed when another employee said i’ve been working that long, and said “there’s no way”. 

i have some social anxiety and also was diagnosed with high functioning autism and this job just makes me feel worse about myself. can someone say mistakes they’ve done to make me feel better?",keep crying over my mistakes at work…

1298,DunkinDonuts,"why did they change the vanilla/ french vanilla  flavor , and make it some strange tasting foul chemical that people hate?

this causes the entire coffee to be ruined and needs to be throw out. 

is it because the people at dunkin donuts don't care about the quality of the product they sell?

a lot of places have trimmed there menu back and got rid of a lot of peoples favorite.

1327,DunkinDonuts,"okay so today was my third day back and i work overnights at my store! 4 days i do dt and the other two days i’ll be covering the baker’s days off.

i worked dt today and i got almost everything stocked perfectly; if i were to think about what i didn’t check it what i definitely missed, it would include:
- filling the sugar dispenser and splenda dispenser
- cutting lemons
- filling cups underneath the drive thru and front counter stations
- i also forgot to check cold brew oops!

what i did do?
- cleaned and fully stocked the donut case (donut and munchkin boxes, made sure bags were full, etc)
- stocked coke cooler and the two mini fridges 
- all 11 remakes
- most of the dishes (i help it the baker and do most of his when i can)
- trash (got busy so baker took it to dumpster but i gathered it all)
- stocked sandwich station fully
- ran drive thru alone as i do nightly until 5 am
- checked to make sure dairy machines were full
- checked swirls to make sure they weren’t low
- put bagels and croissants in case and sandwich statiob

my job is not to make up for what other shifts didn’t stock. know how many lemons i go through overnight? none. know what that means? 6-midnight should’ve done it. i didn’t have time to as it got busy but even then that is not something that should’ve even been empty to be held against me!!!

my night was pretty slow but i’m also getting used to the grind again as i left at the end of april. i did forget to check the sugar and splenda dispensers but it was busy and all of the morning shift people were there anyways!!

okay, on to the important part. first off, i don’t get out of the window until 6:20 even though i should be clocked out by 6. whatever, happens all the time idrc . that being said, i’m already about to be in overtime so i counted my drawer and clocked out… it was 30 mins into a full on morning shift, they had it handled and if i missed a couple things one f the many people could do it while up front was slow!

i’m sitting in the back because i didn’t take a break all night and i figure i’d talk to my manager when she comes in because i hadn’t gotten to bullshit with her since coming back.

i guess this morning shift girl didn’t know i was still in the back because suddenly i hear her talking about how i didn’t do “much of any thing “ and then my other coworkers and friends were telling her that it’s my third day back and i work on my own all night etc. girl is newer and was all confused talking about how doesnt she have another person? bitch yeah, the baker who is baking all night not stocking your sugar machine?

anyway she talked all this shut literally 20 feet away from me on the other side of the wall because i was in the back and she was talking to the baker at the bakers table which is very close to the back. 

i’m like shaking with anger because i was so nice to this girl and she just watched me run order taking and window for an extra 20 minutes over my shift and she has the nerve to be talking shit about someone who works her ass off? so i got up and started telling her all the stuff i do overnight and how i’m so sorry her sugar and lemons weren’t full but she has all her remakes and a full donut case etc

she finishes cutting lemons and doesn’t even look at me and walks to go out them away and i’m talking louder so she can still hear me and she’s looking around like “who is she talking to?” and my baker is like “you” but then he scolds me and tells me to go sit down because he was already defending me  ️️️

anyways my manager the bajer abd the morning shift lead and i all talked shit about her when my manager came in lmao and the baker was telling my manager about how much more i do than anyone else here and it made my heart full

1336,DunkinDonuts,would anyone have any idea how to make this flavor at home? it’s so addicting and i crave another one soon!,they discontinued the blueberry pomegranate by me
1337,DunkinDonuts,i have the free offer for medium iced coffee in my dunkin app but it's not applying when i add it to cart and i can't click on the offer. is anyone else experiencing this as well? do you have to go in store to claim it?,dunkin app not working for free iced coffee?
1338,DunkinDonuts,"for instance, today i got a small iced latte with the white chocolate swirl. the default choice in the app is whole milk and no sweetener added for 120 calories. i know it's more than that because of the swirls, but the almond milk would affect it too. i wish they had a nutrition calculator!",how do i calculate nutrition info when i sub almond milk?

1340,DunkinDonuts,hi! quick question. i’m flying through o’hare near my birthday and wanted to use my birthday reward while in the airport. anyone know if that works? only asking because i know some starbucks locations won’t redeem rewards (like the target ones). thanks!!,anyone know if birthday rewards can be redeemed at airports?
1341,DunkinDonuts,"the very first time i ordered their hot chocolate it was amazing! it was thick, chocolatey &amp; creamy. the 2nd time, it was downright watery &amp; could barely taste the chocolate flavor. the last time i got it, it wasn’t too bad. it was a little watery but i could still taste some chocolate flavor. anyone else have this experience in with their hot chocolate?",is the hot chocolate suppose to be thick &amp; creamy or flavorless &amp; watery?
1342,DunkinDonuts,i currently work at arby's and i'm thinking about working at dunkin. i'm wondering how stressful it is compared to arby's. at arby's there's car after car after car. the longest we go without a car is 10 minutes and that's about two to three times a day. in that time i have to rush to stock and clean. it's usually just a constant rush of cars with no break in between. i'm pushed a lot to be fast ( i have to be done making the food in 30-45 seconds) in order to get a good dt time. i also get no breaks so it's a constant 7+ hours on my feet. i'm pretty sure dunkin is also under inspire brands so i can imagine there's similar procedure. i'm wondering if someone could give me an idea on how stressful it'll be. i'm getting tired of the gm's constant lash outs about the dt time when i'm the only one on backline most of the time and i'm still expected to help fry station and the running position. we also opened our lobby back up recently so it's 5x worst. i'm trying to leave asap but i don't want to go into something more stressful. i can handle the stress and fast paced environment pretty well but some days i just get tired of it all and my gm does not help.,thinking about working here
1343,DunkinDonuts,there's this one dunkin in my area that use to be 24/7. and they use to always be on point. then the pandemic hit and they switched their hours to opening up at 6am. ever since then they don't even open the store at 6am. and when they do open up maybe a half hour later. they then they'll all the customers that the oven won't be on to 7am. in my head i'm thinking why not just open up at 7am then? take the full entire hour from 6am-7am to prep your opening. so you can avoid having a bunch of angry customers that probably won't return anymore.,anybody have one of those dunkins that are never ready when they are open?
1344,DunkinDonuts,"so this is my first ever job so i went in slightly nervous especially since i’m 17, but i had a bit of confident. the manager made me clock in and watch the food safety videos before putting me on the floor. i did the sandwich station first (pretty easy imo), and near the end of my shift i did a few hot coffees. today’s shift was 8 long hours lol, but tomorrow will be shorter and i will focus on drinks :).

i know this post is a bit useless lol but if you are working there soon or are wondering what the first day can be like, this is the post . i just wanted to post about it cause i’m kinda proud of myself!",first day @ dunkin!!
1345,DunkinDonuts,i bought early this morning as i was heading home. idk if it was because i was feeling better after having a really stressful day. but definitely buying that again soon.,that white mocha hot chocolate is really damn good
1346,DunkinDonuts,does anyone know the number for hr and make a formal complaint?  the store manager will not give me the number for the owner.  i called in sick which was the first time in 5 months except for having covid (6 days off).  she told me if i didn’t come in that she was taking me off the schedule.  then told the owner that  i quit.  any help would be greatly appreciated.  i also never gotcovid pay.,please help!
1347,DunkinDonuts,"about 10 days ago, i posted here about a sketchy interview and hiring process at one dunkin' location in il, there were a lot of personal questions but most importantly they asked me to come at 5:00a for 2 consecutive days for a cup of coffee and if i ""pass"", the owner promised to hire, i really needed the job so i ""passed"" the test, i gave them my ssn and permanent resident card and now it's 12 days since i didn't hear from them, i mean what's going exactly wrong with them? when i gave them my ssn the manager said you're starting next week but then told me it's about e-verify (verification for the eligibility of employment in the u.s.) this an ""e"" process and it takes 3 seconds.",dunkin' hiring process - follow up

1350,DunkinDonuts,i go to dunkin every 2 or 3 days and usually always get a large iced vanilla latte with light ice. does anyone else get these weird muscle twitches from drinking too much coffee? i'm trying to figure out if it's caffeine related or not.,anyone else get muscle twitches from coffee?
1351,DunkinDonuts,"on my momma that shit slap! will be my go to for the rest of the year for sure.

my only complaint is why is this not a permanent flavor?

white chocolate mocha is my go to at starbucks i just hate spending so much for it because starbucks is expensive compared to dunkin.

if dunkin makes this a permanent flavor they will have a everyday customer.

1352,DunkinDonuts,we just went through the drive thru and asked for two pup cups and when we got to the window they charged us 2.15 for both of them. they also didn’t even have the little milk bones in them and weren’t filled all the way ️,how much do you charge for pup cups at your store?

1354,DunkinDonuts,"so back in 2017-2018 i loved the winter white chocolate swirl (i think it was from december - february too) and would buy it every day, to the point the woman at the counter was like ""oh, one second and i will make it for you!"" lol. those were my junior semesters of college and needless to say i gained like 15 pounds at the end of it. so stressful. i haven't had the white chocolate since... but immediately this morning when i smelled my coffee cup i was transported back to my college library, cramming in a tiny cubicle for finals. 

i think this version is less sweet and/or potent than the winter white chocolate i remember. i always got 2 swirls 2 cream in a medium hot and this one tastes much weaker than i remember. idk, i know the coffee varies so much too. i will definitely be trying it again! i still do get a slight toasted marshmallow smell and flavor. 

the pancakes! i saw y'all bash them a bit but honestly i liked them. a little dry and cold but folded in half and dipped in the syrup they weren't that bad. i tasted maybe a hint of orange or citrus of some kind. perhaps they were next to the muffins but idk. lol. i thought they were on par with other fast food pancake options. 

i would not recommend eating these in your car though. i got syrup all over my counter just from opening the container, but carefully eating over the bag would probably work if you had to. make sure you have wet wipes!!",i tried the toasted white chocolate swirl and mini pancakes!

1356,DunkinDonuts,"but basically i always order an iced coffee and then scoop out the ice, i fill up an insulated mug with ice and then drink from there. i just hate how fast they can get watered down and warm in the regular cups. but basically i wondering if i could skip this step. because my assumption was they just use hot coffee and put ice in it to cool it down. also, i don’t want the workers to be annoyed if that causes them to have to change what they do or anything. i appreciate any input, i’m sorry if it’s a dumb question",can i order an iced coffee without ice? sorry if it’s a dumb question
1357,DunkinDonuts,"so i usually go for a small french vanilla swirl iced coffee w regular milk, and depending on the location i'll end up with 2 or 3 shots. perfect. well obviously it's getting freezing out, so i wanted to try the hot version instead. the girl who was working made me sound dumb when i admitted i didn't know exactly what to order to get a similar taste, so i just said french vanilla swirl coffee w regular milk. it tasted sort of bitter to me. so i'm wondering how to get a bit of sweetness back, would i just ask for an extra pump of vanilla or something? i'm trying to avoid giving workers a migraine at 6am when i'm trying to order lol, i'll admit i dont know the first thing about coffee and how to order it since i made it myself for so long but no longer have access to a coffee machine",idiot trying to order coffee- what exactly should i ask for?
1358,DunkinDonuts,"hard pass for me. 
i can’t get past this odd taste they have i don’t know why i thought they’d taste like the eggo mini pancakes (). i tried to eat three, the first one i wasn’t quite sure i thought it was because of the mint aftertaste from this mornings teeth wash. so i tried another (without syrup) which it wasn’t me it was the actual pancake itself that taste off. i gave it another go for the third time with syrup in hopes it’ll help me overcome the taste as i really love pancakes. the syrup did not help what so ever— too watery. and the pancake flavor overpowered it. i also tried nuking the pancakes for a few more seconds (the first time it came out soggy) thinking that would help but to no avail—in the trash they went. (‘:",thoughts on dunkin’ pancake minis?
1359,DunkinDonuts,"after the mostly negative reviews of both items, i got curious. i tried the coffee medium, 3 white chocolate, 3 vanilla shots, almond milk. it was good. definitely tasted different than the regular coffee. a tiny bit more sweet.

now, on to the pancakes. i got mines and they were cold. i tried them without syrup. they weren't overly sweet, which was good. despite being cold, they weren't dry. i was prepared for them to be the same consistency of the cake donuts. lol but the syrup with the pancakes were quite enjoyable, especially with the coffee. the only thing slightly negative i'd say is that the pancakes don't fit into the syrup packet. most people eat these on the go and won't be placing these on plates and pouring syrup on them. i had to rip them in half to dunk them. so either make the syrup container rounder or make the pancake sticks.

thank you for reading.",i tried the pancake minis and the holiday blend
1360,DunkinDonuts,"i'm having nothing but issues with dunkin's iced coffees lately. it doesn't taste like they add any swirls at all anymore.

the french vanilla one used to be sufficient to give the drink a creamy, sweet flavor without any added cream or sugar, but the last one i had tasted like coffee with ice and nothing more which was a real disappointment since the location i got it from is usually really good about making great tasting drinks. 

i contacted corporate and they just threw 200 points in my account and didn't acknowledge my complaint about the inconsistency of their drinks across locations, or even based on what time you visit or who makes the coffee (i've observed some employees not even putting full pumps of the swirls in my cup even though all my locations have starting charging extra for additional pumps).

today i used the points from corporate to get a large peppermint mocha iced coffee at a different location than last time and it tastes neither like peppermint or mocha. it took me awhile to place it, but i swear it tastes like gingerbread which is odd because i don't even see that as a flavor option. what is going on?

this might spell the end for me with dunkin. i haven't had a truly satisfying iced coffee from them in awhile and it only seems to be getting worse. might have to go to \*gasp\* starbucks or just start making my own iced coffees.",terrible iced coffees lately
1361,DunkinDonuts,"i've been working at dunkin for a few months now and explicitly told the manager i didn't want to be a closer because i don't like being left alone to work by myself. our store doesn't have a drive-thru but we do take mobile orders, uber eats, and doordash orders. however, the store closes at 9pm. on weekdays, one person stays to help the closer and leaves at 6 or 7pm, leaving the closer by themselves from then until 9pm. on sundays, the person helping the closer leaves at 5pm (before the recently new manager, this was 4pm) and the closer must take customers, perform any and all cleaning and stocking, and any closing tasks, all while still getting mobile orders, by themselves. the last manager asked if i could close sundays until he could hire someone to close 3 days a week because we were understaffed, so i agreed to do it for a few weeks. fast forward a little over a month and a half and i'm still closing sundays, being left alone from 5-9. its hella stressful when you've got mobile orders for food and drinks at 7pm and a line of people in the store, ordering a bunch of shit. anytime i tell people i'm by closing the store by myself, they're suprised they dont have more than one person doing it. dunkin's reasoning is that sunday is the slowest day for our store, or they dont have money in the budget to schedule more people (min. wage at my store is $15). i wanted to know if this is normal or if the owners are just exploiting workers to pay the mininum and make the most",one person closing

1390,DunkinDonuts,"hello dunkin workers, i have a question for you. last week i was getting a medium midnight roast every day - i love the taste and it's less acidic than the normal blend. reminds me of a nice dark moka pot coffee. 

anyway, this week, two days in a row i have gotten home and it tastes like they are just giving me the normal blend, which i don't like. 

today i went back and told them that two days now it tastes like i'm being given the normal roast, because it tastes nothing like last week.  ive worked retail before, so i wasn't karening them, just stating that it tastes nothing like what i had all last week. 

i appreciate that they gave me a new drink, but as expected, they were being passive aggressive/accusatory with how the original drink was definitely midnight.  

just for note, i brew with a french press, pour over, aero press, moka pot, and even a manual espresso machine at home - so it's pretty obvious to me when i'm given the wrong coffee. and the difference between normal roast and midnight is night and day (hehe..)

my question, any they likely just giving me normal blend because they don't want to brew midnight, or is there a way they are just not brewing it right?  if they don't feel like brewing it, i don't care, just tell me you're out and don't make me waste my time and money.

1396,DunkinDonuts,"hello, and good morning! i just wanted to share my experiences with dunkin. i have been getting a coffee every morning for the past 4-5 months. my addiction first began when i went to buy my office 2 dozen donuts. i smelled this chocolate drink, which the person who ordered it wasn't happy about, but anyway after that i decided to buy one myself. its called the cochamocha, i bought one and loved it. i started getting one every morning during the week. but i've noticed that 3-4 times out of 10 my order is wrong. sometimes they don't add the foam, sometimes, they make it iced instead of hot, and sometimes i don't even know what they do wrong. 
its expensive getting coffee every morning, and i've started making my own recipe at home.(i use dark chocolate, swiss chocolate mix, instant espress, and attempt to froth my own whole milk. its not bad at all!) all i need to do is buy a latte machine, and then i can say goodbye to dunkin. 
most issues with my order are that it tastes nothing like a cochamocha, and when i try to bring up the issues with the staff they are very rude. they get an attitude. i walk up and say ""i'm sorry, i ordered a cochamocha, but this doesn't taste like it."" i try my best to be polite but they always get cold with me. its to the point where i don't want to bother them. i don't want anyone spitting in my drink. i had one lady give me the finger because instead of fixing my drink she just added whipcream and i came back after work to see if someone else could fix it. 
getting the wrong order can really screw up your morning. i need the extra caffeine. i work with dementia patients so i need all the energy i can get! a wrong order happened again today, so that is why i am writing this. does anyone else have a similar experience to me? any advice? thank you for taking the time to read this, have a nice day! :)

1401,DunkinDonuts,"when i go to my local dunkin i usually will order through the app, and while ordering coffee always leave the dairy and sweetener option blank as the flavor swirl does the job on its own. for a while, my store has been playing russian roulette with the way they make drinks and today when i pulled up to the window, my cold brew was straight milk. when i asked the lady at the window about it, she said that the ticket didn’t specify that i didn’t want it, and that it just said cold brew and the flavor so apparently that means to put milk and sugar in it. i don’t want to be a karen about the situation, however this situation has happened multiple times and even when a manager hears about it saying that they will “train their employees more” it never happens. i love u dunkin but u make me sad :(",how do i go about this without being an asshole
1402,DunkinDonuts,i only work weekends but i swear this happens way too often. i had someone come in today and say “give me a coffee frappe” so i said we didn’t have it but we have regular and frozen coffee then she told me to ask my coworker about it. like i think i know what is on the menu. i also had a customer a few weeks ago try and tell me that we apple cider even though we don’t have it. i’m a 17 year old being ridiculed by adults it’s very fun,customers who try to tell you how to do your job
1403,DunkinDonuts,"hey there,

my girlfriend and i have been searching for a location in south-central pa that has apple fritters. we've found one about 1 in 5 tries. are people just not that interested in them anymore?

i tried substituting with one from our local supermarket but it has no filling (wtf??).

is there some shortage or did they stop making them or something?


all the best :)",apple fritter shortage
1404,DunkinDonuts,so i got the pb swirl for the first time today and i was honestly disgusted. it takes kind of pumpkiny to me? maybe there was a mistake and they gave me the pumpkin swirl instead idk but it definitely didn’t taste like pb. anyone else notice anything funky with it or should i try again?,pb swirl tastes like pumpkin?
1405,DunkinDonuts,"i mean, i hate a lot of what customers do, but this is a special brand of irritating. i hate people who order like $100-$200 worth of items right in the driveway or at the register, and not bothering to call in in advance. even when it is in advance, they don’t schedule it and either they or their deliverer show up 10 minutes later while we’re swamped with customers already. 

speaking of delivery, fuck doordash for taking their apps away, like god forbid we need to stop an order of 5 boxes of joe and 10 dozen donuts coming in because we’re already struggling with every other delivery service, drive thru, walk-ins, and eat-ins. and it’s always the cunts who order a million items who are the first to complain when we run out of shit.

1406,DunkinDonuts,"so we got the new holo-foil tumblers today. a regular came in and was about to buy one after already placing her order-- that's fine, no big deal. i rung her up and gave her the cup. then she says, ""can you rinse this out for me?"" now, i'm just a month into my job so of course i check with my boss first. she said ""no we can't do that after giving her the cup."" so the regular started getting mad at me and said ""you know what forget it. this is ridiculous. it's obviously too much for you on a friday."" which hurt cus we've been so busy this morning and she kept berating me over the register. all my coworkers called her crazy and we bavarded over customers being mad about the rules we can't control. ugh.","""obviously too much for you on a friday."""

1413,DunkinDonuts,"we’ve got 2 dunkins in our town, one is about 15 min from me and been around forever, other one is 5 min away and on my way to work, but it’s newer (by comparison, still been there 2-3 years) and just… god awful. i’ve given them chance after chance to redeem themselves but today was just my final straw and i absolutely will never go back there. 

like it’s so bad, that i really feel like it needs to be reported to corporate or someone above local management. i ordered my coffee at 7:01 this morning and did not receive it until 7:25, i can’t even flag anyone down to ask bc all the workers keep their heads down and ignore anyone that walks in to pick up. not the first time i have experienced this either. actually, it’s more often than not. drive in takes roughly 20 minutes to get through and backs up 3 cars deep into the main road. i get that short staffing is a problem a lot of places but, literally have never had an issue at the dunkin’ on the other side of town. 

apart from sharing our experience in the app and hoping someone gets back to us, is there a number to call? honestly, i feel like this location needs some sort of audit done. i would be embarrassed to run a business in the manner it’s currently operating at. i worked as a barista for a year in 2017. i know it’s stressful and workers are over worked and underpaid. but this location has really painted dunkin’ in a bad light for me and i’m sure plenty of others in our town. my dad doesn’t go to that location any more for the same reason.

1415,DunkinDonuts,"i've always ordered a bagel with cream cheese on the side (under the impression on the side is easier for the workers...). last time i ordered this they slapped it on my bagel anyway. i was actually kinda annoyed because it was so sloppy and uneven and so messy to eat. i just sucked it up though, they could have misheard me on the speaker.

then today i go to a different location, and ordered on mobile. they gave me cream cheese on the side... in a small coffee cup with a lid! 

personally i really don't care how i get my cream cheese. but i'm wondering if something changed behind the scenes, do some locations not have little things of it anymore and only have like a big tub?

1419,DunkinDonuts,"im an assistant manager at the location i work at. it's me, the store manager, &amp; we only have 1 shift lead atm. i get along pretty well with the store manager but definitely have my thoughts about her..

first-- i work way more hrs than she does, fine whatever. she also consistently comes in 5/10min late everyday (7am.) she never opens &amp; im the main opener, which i dont mind cuz im a morning person anyways &amp; i get out early. 

theres been multiple times where everyone (usually 1 or 2 other people) dont show up to open with me &amp; im completely by myself. i make this known in our group chat app, where i see that she sees it but never replies &amp; still comes in at her scheduled time-- which i feel like if ur the store manager it should be ur responsibility to step up if you know someone is literally alone at the store working.. 

yesterday i was due in at 5am &amp; she was surprisingly there at 4:30am opening by herself (usually i do that) &amp; i was standing at the back door about to walk in when it hit 5:01am &amp; shes already sending me txts asking me where im at &amp; also posting in the group chat. this is from the same woman whose left me alone to run the entire store 3 times &amp; seemed to not give af but ofc when shes alone for 1 fuckin min shes blowing my shit up.. ive gone 3hrs with no help before (granted i did have to tell people that i couldn't make food atm since it was impossible.)

she also disappears to do paperwork/money, etc.. in the office &amp; is gone off the floor at peak rush times, even when theres only 3 of us at a time. i have noticed shes gotten better with this lately tho (thank god) but she then chooses to go run to the bank at the very last minute before a shift change. as an assistant i cannot leave if shes gone at the bank before a shift change cuz i need to stay &amp; make sure everyone whos due to work shows up. i get that but there's been times where regular crew members also can't leave cuz the person relieving them is late &amp; shes gone at the bank. 

im just so fuckin annoyed by her &amp; her ""rules for thee but not for me"" attitude. sorry i just had to get that off my chest. feel free to leave ur own horror stories! all employees of dunkin should seriously hold a convention to collectively get together &amp; bitch about shit like this.",just a rant about my manager (rant with me!)

1421,DunkinDonuts,"so my dunkin barely has any workers. starting pay is $14 but i make $15 an hour. since we barely have people i work 6 days a week (about 90-100 hours every two weeks) so i make pretty good money and bust my ass at my job. although friday’s, saturdays and sundays we have 3-5 people and they expect us to have great drive thru times and balance the front counter which feels almost impossible. we’ve tried to keep the front closed so we can focus on one instead of juggling both but upper management gets pissy. i said if they want us to do both we need more people here. and i was told “we don’t have enough money to pay other people” and it just made me laugh. like i make 22.50 in ot, if i didn’t work ot and you spent half that on someone else’s hours you’d be saving labor cost money in the long run. plus while i like how much i make, 14-15 an hour is like the new minimum wage and people do the bare minimum instead of hustling and working their ass off like some others. i guess i just want my thought process to feel…validated? thanks if you read this far.",just venting.

1456,DunkinDonuts,my boyfriend is allergic to peanuts and i saw they’re adding peanut butter swirl to the menu. someone told me the swirl is peanut free? is this true?,is the peanut butter swirl nut free?
1457,DunkinDonuts,so i'm a donut finisher and u walked into an absolute shit show yesterday. the bakery shorted us around $300 worth of donuts (i only saw one rack of donuts) so the manager and shift leader had to bake a lot until i got there. i ended up working a 10 hour shift between extra baking and cleaning bc the donut room was a mess when i got there.,short rant
1458,DunkinDonuts,i usually like going to this dunkin because the regular guy working there. is usually different from most dunkin employees. really friendly and cool with everyone. even with all the junkies and crazies out front the door. i messed up because i usually pay before hand. but i decided to pay in store today. and it was  a different worker this time. i had him scan my app but the register said i still owed 19 cents. so i said alright i'll pay the rest with my card. i go to check my account later and this fool took the $3.41 from my app and then went charged me $3 and the 19 cents i owe. it's not that the dude is scamming me but it was more obvious that's he's just straight slow and dumb. next time i'll just remember to pay before hand.,i just got charged twice because of an idiot employee

1460,DunkinDonuts,"anyone else have this happen?

https://freeimage.host/i/5dozqn

in the app i ordered a $2 coffee and a $1.25 pack of munchkins. no extra charges outlined and the subtotal rings up as $3.85. with tax it's $4.14. how does $2 + $1.25 = $3.85?

the subtotal is never correct no matter what i order. i've reinstalled the app. i've tried on my husband's phone with a new username. it's not a big deal monetarily speaking, however it is kind of odd. there is no explanation for the subtotal. i understand there are upcharges for certain things, such as cold foam, but the app outlines them clearly and correctly adds them to the subtotal.

for comparison here is the receipt from the same store but ordering in person. same order. subtotal is $3.25 like it should be.

https://freeimage.host/i/5dor7n

minutes later, i was fixing the donut cases when she came back in, asking for 3 more shots of espresso. she said ""there's nothing wrong with the drink it's just that he likes his coffee really bitter and disgusting."" and i laughed saying, ""i mean no harm but when he said three more shots of espresso i was surprised"" and she replied, ""no yeah i saw it on your face when he said it"" so we give her three shots of espresso free of charge in a separate cup and she comes back in a minute or so later, gave us a thumbs up and said, ""i just wanted to say he said it was perfect!"" and we all laughed before she left.

so multiple times i have seen the person in front of me in the drive thru ask the crew member to list every donut they offer. at some stores, this is a considerable number or varieties. my question is who in their right mind asks something like that in the drive-thru.  what an enormous waste of time. you have to be someone who’s never worked in the fast food industry to think that’s okay. they already list the most popular ones on the drive-thru menu. if you need to see more then go inside. fuck these people. know what you want or go inside. that’s it. rant over. 

p.s. thank you to all you dunkin’ workers keeping us going all the time. dunkin’ is my sick addiction and most days the crew person manning the drive thru is the first human being i see that day. i’ve worked in fast food before and i know how thankless it can be. anyways, i appreciate you.",“list every donut you offer”

1529,DunkinDonuts,"i made 3 mobile orders this week and after the third, instead of an automatic free drink offer being added to my account, i got an email encouraging me to make one more purchase to earn my free drink. is anyone else experiencing this? when the terms and conditions mention “participating locations only,” surely they mean for using the free drink and not the initial purchase (or else how would you know who’s participating?). i emailed support but i’m worried they won’t get back to me till monday, which would be a problem if i do need to make another purchase by tomorrow.",is the “free drink for 3 visits” offer not working for anyone else?
1530,DunkinDonuts,i was at the front counter and a guy asked for his order to be to-go and i said ok but it was just a drink and hash browns so i didn’t know what i needed to do. by the way i’m new so that’s why i’m asking,what do you need to do for a “to-go” order?
1531,DunkinDonuts,"menu advertised $3 medium pumpkin cream cold brew and pumpkin spice latte so we ordered one of each. was never told a total, pulled up to the window to pay and when they handed me the receipt the total was $9... $4.29 for the cold brew, $3.99 for the pumpkin spice.

 when i asked about it, the employee said ""taxes are crazy"" i said ""it's not taxes, its ringing up the wrong price"" and she said the menu was wrong. didn't try to fix it or anything, just stared at me and told me the register prices dont match the menu. that's theft in my mind.

this is the second time this has happened in the last month. the first time, the advertised price was only if you purchased through the app, fine print. again, staff was totally apathetic. the drink was nasty too and they didnt offer to remake it, just stared at us hoping we would leave. 

i'm just baffled because i worked in customer service for 8 years at my previous job and always offered to remake something or fix pricing, it's not money out of my pocket and i want the customer to be happy. i'm also very kind to the employees, i know the menu discrepancies aren't their fault but can i just get a little assistance? 

i used to go to dunkin every day, and now i can't ever go without something bring wrong and them being unwilling to help. i've reached out to corporate in the past and never heard back. just sucks...i used to love them and i've just about had enough.",menu prices are wrong?
1532,DunkinDonuts,"i get that their only 99cent, but our ovens only can only cook 6 orders a time, any other weird bulk count makes them undercooked or overcooked, so it’s very annoying when customers order 3+ orders of hash browns, especially when cars behind you want them as well and it’s already hard enough as it is to keep one oven available at any given time (we only have 2 and it’s one person)

yea we could pull you, but in the 2 whole minutes it takes to make a new batch, 15-20 different food items can be ordered (no exaggeration i’m being generous here) it just destroys the whole flow of everything when we’re expected to get your order out in less then 150 seconds from when you start your order until you pay

it's becoming super common that i'll wait 20 mins in a drive thru only to find out my drink was either made wrong, or made with stale / old coffee (super obvious taste when i order the same exact drink every day of my life )

it sucks because over time, i'm throwing away a decent chunk of change because i cant stand bitter coffee (when they don't add my caramel) , or stale coffee taste. 
today i went to two locations and both made them wrong. (one was stale, the other added granulated sugar when i didnt ask for it, way too sweet).

1555,DunkinDonuts,"i don't know about other dunkin locations, i only have 1 in my town but any free drink i'm convinced the manager tells the employees free drinks get no coffee or swirl in them. they have that free monday coffee and i only got it a few times because i've had to dump all of them except 1 and it wasn't because it was good, it just actually had coffee in it, bad coffee but still coffee. same with all my reward drinks i think i've pretty much trashed almost all of them because they were undrinkable and if i did manage to drink one it was never the standard quality. 

not that paying for drinks is much better. this location will almost never put a full amount of swirl in most drinks and there is no way employees don't know to put 3 swirls in the medium when its right there on the sticker and it's been so consistently like this for a long time that i just accept it and enjoy the flavor of the coffee instead. i usually get the cold brew which had been consistently good since it came out but has gotten weaker recently nut was still good enough to drink until they straight up gave a cup of water last time with, of course, no swirl. i don't know how they got it to turn brown when i could literally taste the flavor of the water.

my point is don't be lured in by free drink rewards and offers and waste money like i did. i wish they wouldn't even have them maybe they don't have enough product to keep up with offering free drinks. i was going to stop going a while ago but i get hooked back in when they come out with a new drink and i know if i go the first day or week it comes out they will make it properly and it's really delicious and i like the seasonal flavors they come out with that i can't make at home. which is why i need them to stop these phoney promotions and just have customers pay enough for the store to make a drink properly. 

i have written feedback through the app months ago about this problem and nothing ever changed. last time i did receive a receipt, i think maybe by accident since it was wet and stuck to the cup but i realized that was the first time i ever got a receipt from them and they have a survey on it, now i know why i've never been asked or given a receipt. and yes i filled it out. 

also i tried switching to sbux but came back to dunkin cause i just can't get into their coffee but they always seem to do a nice job making it and i appreciate the effort.",don't be fooled by dunkins free drinks

1586,DunkinDonuts,"so i am an employee and the other day we had a lady come in, she ordered a hot mocha latte. i rang it in as a hot latte with mocha swirl in as we’re taught to. the drink was made and given to her, she drank it then proceeded to yell at us that it does not taste like a mocha latte. so i asked my coworker to remake it and add more mocha because i thought maybe she just couldn’t taste the mocha well. we did that, gave her the remake then she yelled again saying it’s not a mocha latte. so my store manager was standing there, he offered to remake it and while he was, she looked at her receipt and yelled at me that i didn’t ring it in as a mocha latte. i rang it in as a latte with mocha in it. my store manager overheard her and defended me saying i did ring it in right. she then goes about how where she’s from that’s not how mocha lattes are made and that we don’t know what we’re doing. so i am here asking, how is a mocha latte made? what are we doing so wrong?",do we make mocha lattes wrong?

1592,DunkinDonuts,"i order from the app, and i use the in store pickup. of the two stores local to me one starts making it as soon as the ticket comes out of their mobile order printer, or as soon as they can get to it. the other store literally waits until i walk in and ask for my order to start making it... the second method seems stupid to me... if i already ordered it, why would you wait until i am there. this keeps me from being able to quickly stop in a pick up my food. if i didn't want you to prepare it until i was there i would either order in store or open the app when i got there. i travel a bit for work, and every other store i can think of does the same as the first one mentioned. not only that, but to me that is the obvious way it should work, whether from a customer or employee's standpoint. does anyone else have a similar experience? is there any way to give feedback so they may eventually fix this?",mobile ordering - store difference with in store pickup

fast forward to sitting at work enjoying my coffee and my cgm (continuous glucose monitor) goes off. i am climbing 60pts every five minutes. this is bad. obviously they must have put regular sugar in my coffee. i took insulin to cover the croissant.

1601,DunkinDonuts,"just curious as i've never seen another dunkin do this. my local one opens at 6am and you can go inside and make an order. 

the thing is, you have to go inside if it's before 7am. they don't have online ordering for the first hour of their day and you can't make mobile orders. like, they don't turn on the machine or something. the app says ""this location is closed and will reopen at 7am"" when i can walk into the store at say, 6:15 and get my coffee. they have scattered donuts at that time. never ordered hot food though.

is there any other stores that do this? just wanted to ask. my friend says it's so they can get their baked goods ready. i'm thinking it's so they don't have to go to the store at 5am but can start getting things ready at 6am to save themselves an hour in the morning for sleep or something.",is my dunkin allowed to do this?

1607,DunkinDonuts,"so today was a first for me. today at around 5:45/6pm eastern time my fiancé and i went through our usual dunkin drive thru and as we pull up there is a dude just standing at the drive thru order screen - not in a vehicle of any kind. he was looking at the menu but it didn't look like he was talking to the barista. after a few seconds he acknowledges us and looks like he's saying something so i rolled the window down and asked what he said. he asks me if i could pull up further because ""they don't see me out here so they don't know i'm here trying to order"". so i told him i didn't think they would serve him on foot at the drive thru. he said he couldn't go in because the lobby was closed and he couldn't fit his car in the drive thru. he points to his gigantic truck that he's towing another truck on top of. so then the barista tells him he can't be in the drive thru without a vehicle and they weren't going to be taking his order like that. well after he goes back and forth with her for a minute he finally walks off. so we pull up, order and then pull up to the window. while we were waiting for our order the barista apologized for what happened and i said it was fine and that i even told the guy they probably wouldn't serve him. so she goes ""he did the same thing yesterday and we told him he couldn't!!"" 

then another barista goes ""omg he's pulling that huge truck into the drive thru!!"" and sure enough this dude is trying to fit his behemoth vehicle into this tight little drive thru that has a pretty narrow, sharp turn on it to get to the window. and we were all saying the same thing - he's never gonna be able to make that turn!! we were laughing so i told the girl at the window that we would probably be back through tomorrow and was hoping to get an update on how the situation turned out. he was getting stuck and it looked like he got hung up on the curb as i was pulling away. i have no idea if he made the turn or not, how long it took if he did, or if he damaged their building in any way. i am so curious to find out haha i couldn't believe that! dude must have really wanted some dunkin bad!!","pittsburgh, pa pleasant hills dunkin &amp; the guy on foot in the drive thru"
1608,DunkinDonuts,"i just got a team member job at a local dunkin. this is my first food service job; previously i've worked office jobs. i took this job because i wanted to try something different. i'm especially interested in getting experience as a barista.

i've worked there ten days and i'm getting more and more frustrated. on my first day, they stuck me at the drive thru window, and that's almost all i've done since. i've learned how to make a few drinks by osmosis. i've also taught myself to use the pos order entry system at the front desk. but the only thing i've received training on is drive thru. and it's incredibly frustrating because not only have i not been trained on anything since day 1, it's like i'm also being discouraged from doing and learning new things. when i try to step up when we're ten orders behind and there's a twenty-minute queue, i'm told to go back to the drive thru and twiddle my thumbs on the off-chance the customer needs something. when it's slow and i ask my coworkers and shift leads whether there's anything i can help out with or be trained on, i'm told to just worry about drive thru. and the gm, despite telling me when i was hired that i'd be getting a ""real"" training in the first few days of work, still hasn't followed through on that. on the contrary, it's more of the same when i approach him directly: stay at the drive thru window. i don't understand and feel resentful because a) it's not like i can't handle more. i get drive thru. it's easy. b) it's not like i'm not a good worker in general. i finish all of my tasks, i take initiative to learn new things and solve problems i run into independently, and i come in on time or early and often stay late to help out. sometimes very late. c) everyone else was trained to do everything starting on their first day. people who started working there only a few days ahead of me were trained to work multiple stations and get to float around doing different jobs. i'm the only exception. wtf. 

in general, i'm not impressed with management. my gm is a nice guy and he works hard, but he's not very organized or communicative. much like i haven't been trained on many work tasks, i've also had to follow up with him multiple times on various administrative things: onboarding paperwork, what my pay actually is, whether he's looking for part time or full time employment with me, how to check my schedule (i actually learned through a coworker about our location's groupme chat where this info is posted. it then took my gm multiple tries to successfully invite me, even with me standing next to him and giving him my phone #), how to clock in and out, getting tips (which he's been late on once already), etc. he still hasn't sent me the rest of the training videos i'm supposed to do. in addition, we are chronically understaffed, which leads to extremely long wait times for our customers and lots of stress on my coworkers. (and again, despite this, apparently they don't want me to help out when there's a backlog?? i don't understand.)

is this normal? i'm seriously considering jumping ship already, but at the same time it's only been ten days and maybe it will get better...?",getting frustrated as a new hire - is this normal?

alright, here is what happened to me last night, i was closing with the person i had closed with before and it didn’t go so well, i was hoping this time it would be different but i was sooo wrong! 

i took the donuts off the case and placed them on the rack and when i went to push over to drive thru she says no leave them over and i said to her i close the store my way and you close it your way, but i left them there over by the case and walked away grabbed my phone to send a message to one of the shift leaders about it! anyway after i came back inside i never said another word to her, she just flipped out and started going on and on that i (demanding part comes in) should respect “her” and since i wasn’t talking to her it’s a sign of disrespect, that came after i went to get a blue rag to clean the tables in the lobby she asked “where was i going?” i didn’t respond she could’ve easily seen where i was going! that’s when she decides that she is going to walk out and say to me “since you know what to do, you can do it!” i lock the door and sit my mop down and take care of the customers she left in drive thru! 

now the one i worked with i’m calling her “gaby” she is under 18 yes you read it right, and demanding respect!?! my friend that also closes with me some nights came over she was working next door and i told her everything that happened she called our district manager and trust me he wasn’t happy when he got there!",this is a question for employees and if there happens to be managers either gm or dm!

1621,DunkinDonuts,"hi folks. been going to dunkin almost daily for years now, and i've had a couple of issues and i'm curious if any workers or patrons have any answers.

i usually get the 2 for $2 egg and cheese wake up wraps if i'm hungry. recently, two of my local dunkin spots must have made anything with cheese extra. one location charges $1.20 for a slice of cheese and another location 55 cents. so the 2 for $2 turns into 2 for $4.40 because its the $2 plus the $1.20 for each cheese. it makes absolutely no sense. is this a store decision or is it maybe a glitch in the system?

similarly, i used to have the cost of almond/oat milk covered in my free drink coupons but now i have to pay for that.

there are other locations (i'm in nyc btw) that i haven't had this issue with, but the two closest to my apartment are doing this and now i don't want to order food to pay that much.

1643,DunkinDonuts,i ordered a large hot coffee yesterday (was somewhere with crazy cold a/c) and got what looks like a medium.  it's only 16oz?   is this the new large?   didn't the large used to be 20oz?,how many ozs are the hot coffees?
1644,DunkinDonuts,"...and it was mediocre at best :( 

i'm a fall baby and love pumpkin pie, pumpkin muffins, cookies, rolls, etc. but i have come to the conclusion i *hate* it in coffee. i think the difference is it's spice - and i'm more of a pumpkin pie girl than a pumpkin spice girl. 

this tasted odd, that's all i'm going to say. i tried the cream foam part separate and thought it was tasty, but taking a sip of the coffee with it was just bleh. i won't be ordering it again. 

i never had pumpkin iced coffee so i'm going to give that or the iced latte a try next.  i got a free hot coffee today with pumpkin swirl so we'll see how that is tomorrow.",i finally tried the pumpkin cream cold brew for the first time...
1645,DunkinDonuts,"as in, what kind of coffee do you make? are you guys actually pulling shots of espresso when i order an americano or is it just some vat of premixed americano formula that gets poured into my cup?",what are yall making?
1646,DunkinDonuts,"why is it so damn delicious? can someone take a pic of the ingredients?

&amp;#x200b;

also, when is iced apple cider coming back?",what's in the avocado spread for the avocado toast?
1647,DunkinDonuts,basically the title. i ordered ahead and had someone else pick up for me but they couldn't. our break is only 15 mins and we were gonna wait until our next break to get it.,what happens when you order ahead but couldn't pick up right away? how long do dd employees keep the order?
1648,DunkinDonuts,"today i worked my 2nd day at dunkin’ donuts. after rush hour there’s always that lapse in time when not much is going on. if i finished restocking and cleaning my station, what could i do so i’m not just standing around? thank you!!!",occupying time as crew member
1649,DunkinDonuts,"just went into dunkin and ordered my usual lemonade. they said it’s been discontinued. never felt such a loss, i come in every day to get one. is it just a seasonal thing that will return next summer? need to hold onto some hope",rip lemonade
1650,DunkinDonuts,how can i tell my local dunkin’ without being rude that their menus are outdated on all of their delivery  apps? do i call the store?,how to tell my local dunkin’ to update their delivery service menus?
1651,DunkinDonuts,"granted, dunkin isn’t what it used to be anywhere, but it’s even worse outside of new england. growing up in boston in the 80s you could go into any dunkin and you’d see donuts coming fresh off the line getting finished and decorated and placed directly into the store. those days have been lost to corporate greed and the baked goods are garbage now, but at least the coffee was still good.  i’ve been all over the country at this point and it seems like the o my du kind you can get good coffee drinks at are the ones in new england. outside of that the standards are non existent. seems like franchise owners just plop down some half ass manager and let teenagers run the place. it’s not their fault though. poor management plus corporate greed are what killed dunkin.",how did dunkin’ get this bad?
1652,DunkinDonuts,"i'm a simple guy, i see september peaking at me through the calendar and i get excited for one thing - dunkin donuts iced apple cider. so why in the world does it seem to be so limited this year?! i live in ma and we've gotten it nearly every year other than this one for the last 5-10 years. now i can only seem to find when i'm up in maine; all of the dunkins around me in ma and nh don't seem to be carrying it. 

is there any official messaging on what's going on with straight up apple cider this year, or am i going to have to rely on my few maine weekends to get my cider fix?",why is iced apple cider so limited this year?!
1653,DunkinDonuts,i never knew this was a thing until i seen some kid ordered this a while ago. and for some reason i kind of remembered it again. and was going to try to make a mobile order for it. but there was no option to choose bacon unfortunately. i probably ate some weird shit as a kid too. but i gotta see if this weird concoction actually taste well when sober lol.,any of you ever had a bagel with cream cheese and bacon?

1655,DunkinDonuts,so i was hired as an opener and was told i’d make more than minimum wage so i accepted. got paid and saw it was minimum. they told me that i have to wait a month for evaluation to see if i’m a good fit to be an opener before i start higher pay. they never even told me how much. i’m going to leave as soon as i have enough money for a car and can go to better jobs farther away. i’d guess around almost two months of my starting date. but i also want to use my time off to use said car i get to see my boyfriend that my mom doesn’t know about. so i was gonna just say i’m at work. but i wanna know how long i can get away with it before even planning it really. i’ve heard some people ask for two and almost get fired.,how do i use the most of my sick days before leaving?
1656,DunkinDonuts,"my first day at dunkin donuts was yesterday. i was hired for the ""baker"" position. when i went in on my forest squeduled day, they instead immediately put me on drive through, which i'd never done before. i think there was one other new girl. they taught me how to make one of the regular coffees, but it's was super busy and chaotic and i ended up standing around waiting for someone to teach me the drinks. 
manager came out and asked me to sweep the floors and wash the tables which is a bad sign, and then told me i could just go home. all within two hours. 
dissapointed and not quite sure what's going on or if i should go back tomorrow.","first day, kinda concerned"
1657,DunkinDonuts,"just got a job that isn't dunkin, can't wait to leave that 2 week notice on the desk in the morning!",i quit!
1658,DunkinDonuts,"i left dunkin in june, but something that totally perplexed me was the price of the individual munchkins. we had a system that could ring them up individually, and each one was 15 cents. for comparison, at my store, a 25 pack was $7.13 after tax. the math obviously doesn't check out. if you rung up a 25ct as 25 individual munchkins instead of a 25 box, it would be $3.75. does anyone know what the story is with this? it's probably an oversight, but i haven't been able to get this out of my head since. and even if your store's computer system can't ring up individual munchkins, what is the price of the smallest denomination of munchkins you can ring up, and how does that stack up against the 25 (or 50, 100) counts?",for the stores that can ring up individual munchkins: are your individual munchkins cheaper than the boxes?
1659,DunkinDonuts,"hello. a few months ago i took a road trip, and along this road trip i stopped at a dunkin that had an ultimate bacon brioche sandwich. we don't have that at any of the dunkins near me and i was wondering if any dunkins were still selling them",ultimate bacon brioche sandwich
1660,DunkinDonuts,"hi all! i’m an avid dunkin lover and just had a quick question i couldn’t find online. how many shots of espresso are in a large iced latte?
i know that there are two in both a medium and large latte from starbucks, and was wondering if it was similar at dunkin?",espresso question
1661,DunkinDonuts,"at least 3 or 4 times a week employees are driving to other stores for products. it seems they never allow the managers the budget they need for supplies, and as a result, they run around trying to beg borrow and trade for what they need and we constantly run out of things.",how often do employees have to go to other stores for supplies?
1662,DunkinDonuts,the grilled cheese is actually amazing. i just really like it because the bread is really nice and they don’t cover it in butter.,the grilled cheese is so good

1664,DunkinDonuts,"so this is my 3rd order from my local dd, each time i've thought the bleachy aftertaste on everything was a fluke, but it's not.

everything from the hash browns to the sandwiches taste like they were dropped on a freshly bleached floor and then mopped around to really lock in the flavor. it's incredibly gross and off putting. i couldn't eat more than a bite of anything i ordered and got it refunded.

is my local dd just garbage? or is this something systemic with dd, because if it is... oof, how is dd still in business.",food tastes like bleach?
1665,DunkinDonuts,"hi all,  


is it bad etiquette to submit a mobile order while waiting in line at the drive thru?  


let met explain by sharing my recent experience.   


this morning, i submitted a mobile order (two lattes and half a dozen donuts) while waiting in line at the drive thru. this location was not busy, but i typically do this for a few reasons, and i thought it was more convenient on both sides. i was even under the impression that the drive thru mobile orders were not prepared until you reached the speaker regardless.  


anyways, a moment later i reach the speaker and say that i just submitted an online order. the employee was clearly frustrated and said that i can't just submit an order and immediately pick up at the drive thru. and that i need to give time for the order to be prepared. i tried to explain that i was not expecting the order to already be prepared, but i doubt i made that point clear. sensing further frustration,  i tried to just cancel the order but they said it was too late, it was already started. i relented, said thanks, and when i reached the pickup window i was greeted by a friendlier employee and the order was immediately ready.  


what happened?   


i think the first employee was having an off day, but it raises the question, is placing a mobile order while waiting in the drive thru bad etiquette?   


i do this frequently, albeit at a different location, without issue. but maybe this was the first time an employee was willing to share this feedback. should i just wait until i reach the speaker to place an order?  


i would greatly appreciate an outside perspective.  


thank you.",etiquette of placing mobile order inline at drive thru?
1666,DunkinDonuts,i had bought the pumpkin cold foam cold brew earlier. and i was confused at first why i didn't like it. because i usually buy the other cold foam drink all the time. then it hit me that i didn't add any milk to it. so the coffee flavor was hitting way more than normal. i'm going to have to do a retry and see how it goes next time. also does anybody else have when they give you a cold foam drink in the cup made for iced lattes instead of the sippy top that's made for the cold foam? definitely makes it less enjoyable because now you have to drink it with a straw.,definitely need some milk in the mix
1667,DunkinDonuts,"so i love dunkin and i almost get it every day.

i know this is going to trigger a lot of people but i don’t really like the pumpkin swirl on the ice coffee.

i was really in love with the butter pecan summer batch iced coffee and even the caramel when butter pecan wasn’t around, but i can’t get around to liking it, it leaves a bad aftertaste.

but i am open to trying different combos for pumpkin since the offer is 3$ going on. anything to mix it with or put to make it a little sweet but not too much with the pumpkin cold brew or pumpkin spice signature latte since that is the 3$ deal.",anyway to make pumpkin good?

1709,DunkinDonuts,"hope this is ok to post there - but as a fellow dunkin' frequenter thought i'd share how i save some $$ on my daily purchases..

i use this app ""fluz"" --&gt;  [https://joinfluz.app.link/osullivan28497a66](https://joinfluz.app.link/osullivan28497a66) mainly for the benefit of generating credit card points through gift card purchases, but that's another topic :)

where it comes in handy for dunkin is that they have a select few stores (including dunkin) that give you back 35% in savings when you purchase a gift card through them ($3.5 max each voucher). so i purchase a dunkin card for $10 and the app awards me back $3.5 for that purchase. 

you get $5 in rewards when you sign up i believe, 3 free vouchers to start with when you use the above link to sign up +3 other free ones every month, just by making posts on their community message boards. so all in all, it's pretty easy to get at least a few of these monthly for savings over time..

at the risk of sounding like a robot/salesman, i'll stop here! but the app is a pretty cool source of savings if you're into that kind of min/maxing stuff - feel free to pm me for more info, if needed.

hope someone is able to find this useful, enjoy!",little tip for big dunkin' savings :)

international delight iced caramel macchiato with milk and french vanilla creamer. creamy, smooth and sweet! i always make sure i have ice in my freezer, so i have 3 ice cubes. its fantastic and should last you a bit and save you some money. you should be able to buy the id cartons in any grocer. i tried the mocha, it was ok. 

another option is the starbux version, caramel of course! enjoy",a very sweet and creamy money saving alternative to dd! wanted to share one of my goto at home dupe drinks

1722,DunkinDonuts,"so i know about a year ago now, the vanilla spice was made optional and discontinued at many stores and the stores that *do* have it, have it in the hot chocolate machine and it’s made with water. 

one store near me still has it. could i ask for it to be made with oat milk or something? hell, can i just ask for the powder in a cup and i’ll mix it with milk at home? i don’t want to make extra work so i feel bad but i used to get this drink literally every day and it’s so gross with water. would they be allowed to do this? don’t wanna get anyone in trouble either",vanilla spice with milk...?
1723,DunkinDonuts,"i'm tired of the same old. i've been getting either signature lattes or cappuccinos forever. i figured out that they are much better without sugar added...is that how they are meant to be made?

i am so happy that i can finally order two flavors on the app, they never used to allow that. did dunkin' actually listen to feedback?

anyways i've been getting smoked vanilla and cookie dough swirl. nothing beats it with whole milk and whipped cream. but when drinking a latte/capp, am i supposed to mix it up or drink the top/bottom first?",what is your favorite drink? need ideas
1724,DunkinDonuts,"i recently discovered that a large iced cappuccino with less ice, no sugar, and 2 swirls of cookie dough and smoked vanilla is heaven in a cup. i can also get whipped cream at no charge. 

it made me realize that (sorry dunkin' employees) the signature latte is a ripoff. a latte is mostly milk with a dollop of espresso, and more often not it gives me the squirts.

i noticed something weird about the dd app. they recently added the ability to do 2 flavor swirls, but it doesn't seem to let me choose the number. i pick 2 swirls on smoked vanilla, but when i tap cookie dough it doesn't let me see the number for either. does this mean i'm getting 2 or 4?

oh and one more thing. i've been stacking free beverages across several accounts all summer because of a 100 point promotion on mondays. well i ordered 2 mondays ago and didn't get the 100 points. i reached out to dunkin email support the same day and got no reply after a week. i sent another message through the online form this monday and still, no reply.

1763,DunkinDonuts,"here's how the game works if you haven't played it yet via dunkin carnival (dunkincarnival.com).

there's three rows of dunkin products attached to balloons, you pick any from numbered #1 to 3 and mash a button that sprays a water gun and fills up the balloon. you battle against bot players that will fill the opposing balloons. first balloon to fill up and pop the balloon wins.

but the problem is, the balloon pops at random chance, not how much effort you put into the game. truth be told, the game already selects if you're a winner or not. if you're selected as a loser, it doesn't matter if you mash your mouse or tap your screen to hell, the balloon will lock at it's fullest state and not pop, leaving the other bot players to win.

but if you don't play hard enough it seems like you lost because you didn't put in enough effort, which is also false.

in my opinion the interactive 'gameplay' element should be removed before it causes frustration. you should pick a number, click it, then it plays an animation of you filling up the balloon and the other bot players beating you if you lose, the balloon popping first if you win. not you mashing buttons to see that the balloon refuses to pop no matter what and seeing a big ""haha, that effort was for nothing, take the l, loser"" in your face.","dunkin's latest carnival game on the site, balloon pop, is very misleading and can be potentially upsetting"

place my second order for a second large latte i will just drink tomorrow or monday. i go to the free reward, click on it and this big barcode pops up, but then it says ""continue to scan **and pay**"" but all i see is ""continue to scan"" so of course i click that and the lady scans the barcode and i come home. i will also add i always mobile order so i'm not familiar with all these barcodes popping up.

1798,DunkinDonuts,"let me preface by saying i hate working here haha but i needed money and this job was the only one available that worked with my schedule. having said that, my feelings are going to be biased negatively. 

recently we had a health inspector come and basically tell management that everything is wrong. and it is. no labels anywhere, sinks are gross, the drain pipes are barely cleaned and our ac is busted so it's unsavory work conditions. my managers also like to fuck off at 11am when the rush is over so they weren't present when the inspector came which was noted. 

my management is also notorious for shorting everyone their hours and not paying what people have worked. they also like to change prices on the menu frequently and blame it on corporate when other dunkin location prices in the area are cheaper (is a large iced latte supposed to be $6?). they're also so obsessed with the timer and pull up all the cars making workers run out with orders but no one to stay inside to make quick coffees. i want to tell all the customers that come to this location, especially the regulars, that this dunkin is no good and their money is better spent somewhere else. 

they also like to never make the sunrise and midnight hot coffees and instead just put an espresso shot to ""cut costs"". when they leave my coworkers and i will always make fresh batches of both. none of what they do makes sense to me and i'm looking forward to the day they get shut down.

1850,DunkinDonuts,i was informed by a friend of mine who works there that they’re not getting breaks at all and they’re a minor. they work up to 8 hours at a time with no break which is literally illegal according to child labor laws in my state which prevents minors from working for more than 5 hours at a time without a half hour break. is this an isolated problem or is anyone else not aware of this rule?,are the minor employees in this sub getting proper breaks?

1856,DunkinDonuts,"i'm one of those crazy people that has chosen to go low carb and have been doing it for 3+ years with tremendous success and lately have been enjoying some dunkin and want to learn about the almond and coconut milks being used.

first question is almond breeze and silk are the brands as far as i know,  are they sweetened? 

i am looking at the nutritional information on that dunkin releases and i can see the following:

large iced coffee with coconut milk is 20 calories and 1 total carbs - this would lead me to believe that the coconut milk is not sweetened.

large hot coffee with almond milk is 35 calories and 5 total carbs with 5 grams of added sugar. (sweetened maybe)? calories a little low for the sweetened version but that maybe the amount of almond milk used.

large vanilla iced macchiato with almond milk is 100 calories 16 total carbs with 13 added sugar. this speaks that the vanilla almond milk is sweetened or there is sweet vanilla syrup added.

ma’am you can order your pick up through dt if you like. 
no i can’t it doesn’t work it’s says unavailable! literally at that moment the buzzer goes off for ogt dt. (thank you dunkin gods ️)

now it gets worse! she says are you freaking deaf?! i said owners! (everyone has now stopped what they are doing and looking at both of us)
ma’am they are not here. the sm is. 
fine, but i will at some point speak to the owners and i’m telling them your lying and rude. that you just don’t want work and that’s why the otg is not working.

didn’t matter lady didn’t care about anyone being over worked or having to wait to get their orders. meanwhile otg machine is still buzzing and she sees someone come in and get their otg dt order inside. since the dt line was so long came in. she turns back to me and starts saying why did i let them get their order. i literally turned around and walked away. 
sm gave her owners email and she asked to please stop yelling at the staff. 
she says as she leaving your gonna lose me and a lot of other customers because your so lazy! 
she leaves and our quietest coworkers says bye bye bitch! we don’t want no customers like you anyway!

i’ll go first, so around january when masks were still required and covid was more rampant than ever we had this guy walk in without a mask on. so during that time we were being told that masks were a requirement and to not take any orders from people that weren’t wearing masks, and that if we did we would get a warning and a write up. so we told the guy very calmly “i’m sorry sir but do you have a mask? we aren’t able to take your order if you don’t have one since it’s a store policy”, at the time it wasn’t just a store policy but a state executive order so it wasn’t out of the norm to say that, let me tell you this guy’s demeanor did a complete 180, he started cussing us out, screaming that we were infringing on his personal freedom and that we were being brainwashed by the media and how it was all fake, and when we refused to budge he then demanded to know all of our names and how he was going to report us and a whole bunch of stuff, at the end we had to threaten to call the police so he would leave, the poor girl who initially took his order quit after that since that hadn’t been the first time that this had happened. after that whenever people would start to yell and demand our names we would start messing around and giving fake names, people started to give suggestions over the head-sets, my favorite suggestions were laquisha, tyquan, becky, candy, brad, sugar, and a whole much of stuff.

ten seconds later i looked on my receipt. she placed my order as a regular latte with 1.00 extra coconut milk. 

i showed her that , explained coconut milk latte is its own order. if i order a latte with a side of coconut milk , i would totally understand, but the store is advertising coconut milk latte for 575 so why would that not be the free drink. she said again that they add an extra dollar for the coconut milk and latte is 4.75. i said ok and just left.

i got mine with the lemonade which is their poster rec. the bubbles in large quantities taste like cherry flavored cough syrup to me. i diluted the entire drink with spindrift pink lemonade seltzer so it was drinkable but overall i would skip this order. if you want good popping bubbles, i'd go to a bubble tea shop since you can customize the tea, flavor, and sweetness as well as the flavor of the bubbles.",thoughts on the strawberry popping bubbles?
1943,DunkinDonuts,"i tried to get the pink strawberry coconutmilk refresher today from one of my dunkins, they said it’s discontinued. i tried to let them know that they should probably fix the signage outside because it’s a little confusing — def sounded like a karen, really meant it as a recommendation since it is deceptive. 

then i tried strawberry lemonade, which they said is also discontinued. considering i saw signs out front and in the store advertising strawberry lemonade i was kinda confused. finally, the manager who was increasingly frustrated with me, was like “the best i can give you is lemonade with strawberry bubbles,” which she did, and then they said they don’t have boba straws. so basically i didn’t even get to have any bubbles.

1962,DunkinDonuts,"\*disclaimer: i can only speak for my store, and anything i will say is not necessarily representative of other stores\*

my store has a drive thru, and just about every day there is always a mad rush within the last 10 minutes before we close, with the line spilling out onto the street. our store works best when there are 4 or 5 crewmembers working the closing shift, though due to staffing shortages we have been running on 3 people (the bare minimum: 1 person each on drive thru order/register, beverages, sandwich). because we have 2 stations, drive thru and the walk-in/front lobby, we have two stations to clean up and it is a lot of work for 3 people. about 30 minutes before closing we begin to discard most of our stock, so we usually only have enough coffee (both hot and iced),as well as iced and green tea for 4 or 5 larges of each. we have also begun the process of closing down by then, and all of the machines are fully stocked and cleaned. it is difficult and annoying to have to set something up for one customer, only to take it down again. if we don't do this, we are stuck cleaning for well over an hour after closing which nobody wants to do after 9-10 hour shifts. unless all you're getting is a simple drink or two, please make every effort to come in earlier. 

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr:

please make every effort to not order within the last half hour of closing of any dd store, because it disrupts the closing process, and our inventory/stock is more limited by then. come in earlier, and it will be easier for us to fulfill any orders which benefits both the customer and crew.  for example, if a store closes at 8pm, try to order by 7:30. we really appreciate it :)","psa: please please make every effort not to order within the last hour, come in earlier if possible"

2007,DunkinDonuts,"had cookie dough swirl for the past 3 days, different style of coffee every time.

cold brew, cappuccino, and regular iced coffee (considering trying sunrise batch + cd).

it tastes like those homemade edible cookie dough bites or those candy cookie dough bites in theaters and groceries. in my opinion, it's not going to top butter pecan for me but it is very nice and refreshing to have. i do like mixing things up so i won't get sick of bp and this swirl will do nicely.

it's seems pretty mildly flavored for a swirl. the flavor of espresso greatly compliments but fights the cookie dough flavor, i'd prefer it but i may consider a pump extra. while with weaker coffee such as brew (iced/hot), the cookie dough flavor should be more obvious. even then, try it with regular pumps and see if you want a pump extra.",cookie dough swirl thoughts
2008,DunkinDonuts,"hi guys, i'm a new employee at dunkin' donuts (started last monday) before dd, i worked at a locally owned cafe shop where i received professional barista training and i also worked at starbucks, so needless to say i'm pretty familiar with making espresso drinks. i started working at dd for a summer job and because it was within walking distance to where i live.

starbucks has a very specific system when it comes to making espresso drinks, the shots are pulled to order. the tall gets one shot, and the grande and venti get two shots unless the customer asked for extra. then, add the syrups and then fill the milk or water. if it is an iced drink, they fill the milk to the line indicated on the cup, and then the rest is filled with ice, it's a pretty easy, straightforward system to learn.

however, at dd, there seems to be no rhythm or reason to how these drinks are made. my manager fills a pitcher full of espresso shots and just leaves it sitting there all day, which in my opinion, is gross. nobody has any clue how many shots each drink is supposed to be getting and i witness my managers putting an enormous amount of espresso in drinks all the time. it honestly makes me worry about the customer's health. i also noticed at dd, the iced cups have lines and numbers inside of them as well, which leads me to believe that they are supposed to be made in a manner similar to starbucks where the ice is added last, but if i don't add the ice first, the manager gets ticked. i don't understand adding the ice first at all, when you are pouring the iced coffee, tea, etc all it does is bounce off the ice and make a huge mess. the syrups cannot get mixed correctly like this either

nobody here understands the art of steaming milk correctly. listening to the steam pitcher make that horrible ringing sound is the worst thing in the world. none of my coworkers seem to get that the milk steamer should not be making that sound and when i say anything about it all i get is ""well that's how it is.""

so please tell me is this normal?? because i really feel like it isn't. anytime i ask questions about this all i get is ""well, this is how i was trained.""",is this normal? or is the store i am working at just weird? (espresso drinks)
2009,DunkinDonuts,"i usually dont add any sugar, so the label automatically usually says unsweetened. if i add stevia in the raw on the app, will it still be unsweetened other than that?","if i order a iced green tea with stevia on the app, will it come unsweetened?"

wrong: this peach passion fruit flavor is horrifying. it tastes like a rotten peach got mixed up with those god awful passion fruit starbursts.

2031,DunkinDonuts,"hopefully this goes through this time.

i started working at my dunkin' a week or two after i turned 18. (i am 19 now so it has been a full year.) i was the youngest worker in the store and honestly, my co-workers treated me differently because of it.

to start off, i applied to work part time, and i told the owner and manager that during my interview. since i was 18 i was supposed to start college soon. well some paperwork issues happened with my college and i didnt get to start until almost november. dunkin' saw this free time i had as an opportunity and scheduled me for more than 40 hours a week, for almost a month. however my checks would read 38 or 39 hours and i always assumed i was counting wrong. (turns out they dropped my hours so i wouldn't get benefits since i was technically part-time).

the employees there treated me like a running man. even though i was trained in every station and could work it effectively, i was never assigned a station in the morning, i was just expected to run around and help any station that was overwhelmed. i was fine with this, until employees would start yelling at me because they needed help and i was somewhere else. one employee in particular expected me to drop everything i was doing the second they called me, even if i was actively talking to a customer.  

because i was expected to be everywhere at once, i was never allowed to sit down or even lean against the counter. after the rush ended i was expected to stock up or wipe everything meticulously, my manager's signature catchphrase was ""if you got time to lean you got time to clean"" yet you'd always see him leaning/sitting down. i had to use my bathroom breaks to get a chance to lean and take a breather. but that didnt stop anyway from yelling at me from behind the counter to hurry up because people were in line.

i could never use my phone, even if i was in the back with no customers in the lobby. someone would always say something like ""go stock xyz"" or ""yknow the boss is watching on the cameras"" despite the fact that some employees would actively be on a phone call during the morning rush. i never sat on social media at work either, it was usually to text my parents about when i was getting home and if i needed a ride.

the last time i complained about how i felt disrespected while working there, the manager told me word for word that i was imagining it and ""maybe i had some problems at home that i needed to work on."" honestly that should've been the biggest red flag but it was my first job and i always told myself that maybe i was being dramatic and all jobs were like this.

maybe i am still being a bit dramatic, but even if i am i don't care anymore. the job made me feel terrible and theres always others, that will hopefully treat me better.","lets try this again, i quit my dunkin because it was a nightmare"

3. one older woman always gets two xl decaf coffees and wants them to be freshly brewed and burning hot. also always makes a joke at the speaker (“can i get a kitten/ticket to disney/ranch salad”). it always throws me off.

2071,DunkinDonuts,i’m 17 and have been working at dunkin for almost 3 weeks now. recently i’ve been the only one closing the store. i have fixed hours but my manger keeps asking if i can work on my days off. he also keeps cutting my hours. for example i’m supposed to work from 1-9pm. but he asks me to come in at 4 or 5-9. i was told i wouldn’t close alone until a month or so but i’ve been forced to close by myself three times now. i know we are very understaffed. but is this normal? it’s my first official job so i’m not sure.,is this normal?

2075,DunkinDonuts,"i applied and heard back quickly, had an interview a couple days later and the assistant manager said to come back in an hour to fill out all the paperwork. is it usually over a week before hearing back about when to start?",how long between getting hired and actually starting?
2076,DunkinDonuts,"first, start with the size you want. small, medium or large, (or extra large for hot drinks). then, specify what drink you want. “hot latte” or “iced coffee” for example. then, say what you want in it (sugars, creams, milks, flavor shots and swirls, etc.)

i know it may not seem that hard, but the pos requires us to choose size first, then what kind of drink before we can modify it. it’s hard when a customer comes in saying “i want a hot hazelnut with 2 sugars.” what size? a hot hazelnut what? a latte? a coffee? or it’s even worse when the customer says “can i get 2 pumps of french vanilla, 1 and a half caramel, whipped cream and drizzle?” like you’re just going to have to repeat your modifiers because i don’t even know what drink it is that you want, i don’t know the size or anything. then customers get mad when you ask to repeat yourself. please just be respectful, we’re people too :)

(also, another tip, don’t order signature lattes, they’re more expensive than regular lattes. if you want a caramel craze and want to save a couple cents, just say you want a caramel iced latte with cinnamon sugar and whipped cream. it’s cheaper. same with the butter pecan sundae, order a butter pecan iced latte with sprinkles and whipped cream with caramel drizzle!)

i’m also going to add one more thing. when you’re ordering, be patient please. don’t list 5 different very specific drinks back to back without giving us the time to input them and make sure they’re correct on the pos. let your cashier ask what else you would like when they’re done with the first drink. especially to the new workers, the pos can be confusing and difficult to navigate, so some patience with us is nice. if you’re ordering for a group at work or for friends and have the drinks or food written down on a paper or in a text, you can just show us instead of reading it over and over again, it’s actually a little easier (imo) to see what drink someone wants written down instead of hearing it.

2115,DunkinDonuts,"the other day i tried a peach coconut refresher and immediately noticed it was very *very* slightly carbonated. i didn’t dislike the way it felt and it was barely noticeable but if i just let the drink sit in my mouth without swallowing and it was definitely noticeable. today at work i made myself a strawberry one just because i wanted to try it. i completely forgot about the day before until i took a sip and instantly noticed it was very slightly carbonated. i asked and one of my coworkers was surprised they weren’t the only one who thought it felt carbonated.

has anybody else noticed it?? i’m not sure what’s causing it but tomorrow i’m going to try the coconut milk and concentrate separately and see whats causing it.

2137,DunkinDonuts,"so i started at dunkin today hoping to have a job for the summer and it was a trial by fire, to put it kindly. i was under the guise that i would be trained this week but i was already at the window and making (probably very poorly tasting) drinks. one person didn’t show so it was a shit show as it was only me and someone else. everyone was very kind when there aren’t 5 cars lined outside (understandably), but they clearly have staffing issues. my manager said it was a good first day, but personally i don’t think i can handle a summer of this.

2141,DunkinDonuts,i’ve been craving matcha lately and dunkin’ is closest for a quick craving satisfaction. what would be a good way to order matcha? with with kind of milk? also has anyone tried the new coconut milk vanilla matcha or adding fruity syrups like raspberry? which do you prefer? i got a matcha with almond milk and one vanilla swirl it was good but didn’t like the vanilla flavor as much as i thought i did. maybe the shot would be better?,good matcha orders
2142,DunkinDonuts,"i saw there was a promotion going on where if you order ahead you get 200 free points, but it only gave me the regular amount of points. i wasn’t sure if it maybe had to be a specific type of drink? or is this a glitch?",anyone else not get their free drink?
2143,DunkinDonuts,"i am normally pretty tolerant of customers in the drive thru.  you want a drink with 8 customizations?  sure!  you want 5 sandwiches?  no problem!  i always try to be nice to people, and they are typically nice to me as well.  however, i will never understand why some customers think it's okay to be on the phone while in the drive thru.  if you are just finishing a phone call, or you pause your phone call to order, i don't mind at all!  but actually starting your call when you get to the speaker?  or telling me to wait so you can continue talking on the phone?  i swear this happens once or twice a day and i am stunned by the audacity of these people each time it happens.  obviously i try to be patient and i won't be rude to the customer but it makes it tough to be nice when a customer just sits there on the phone while i'm waiting to take their order.  it sucks for the other people in line too, because they are trying to be in and out of the drive thru in a timely fashion.

2147,DunkinDonuts,"a lot of weird things happened during my 45 minute drive through experience today but the strangest part that i cannot explain was the actual donut i ordered. i later have deduced that the printer was broken and that made the line long and the encounter awkward. but seriously how does this happen to a donut? i wish i would have taken a picture...

 i always get a jelly donut. i know it is raspberry flavored apple jelly inside. it wasn't today!  it had what tasted like straight strawberry smuckers jam in it... i cant decide if they ran out of jelly donuts and made their own with store bought jelly, or if they got donuts from the local place down the street.... it was so weird. the jelly was way too sweet and wet and leaked through the other ends (top and bottom not side where they smoosh it in). plus the flavor, texture, everything was off!

such an odd experience. i can explain away the wait time, messed up drink, poor communication by, what i assume, was the printer being down, but how about the strange donut filling????

2148,DunkinDonuts,"since the pandemmy initially started we had a few people who refused to wear masks but since it has become the norm we didn’t really have that problem anymore. my store is in nyc and recently with the cdc announcing the new mask mandate people have been coming into argue about the mask policy we still have. personally, i don’t want to argue with them but our store has a policy and we get into huge trouble if we serve people without a mask. because of this we even have free masks for customers who do not have one. still yesterday i had 2 people come in during rush hour to hold up the line and argue with me and my coworkers (we’re all 18,19) and they were slamming the table and cursing us out and made one of my coworkers cry.

2150,DunkinDonuts,"so i know there has been a lot of negatively charged reviews on the refreshers, but i tried two of them and they really weren’t that bad! 

i tried the strawberry dragon fruit and peach passion fruit. 

to me, the strawberry one tasted almost identical to starbucks’ pink drink. however, i am not a huge fan of the the pink drink. i think the only distinguishing part was the aftertaste of dunkin’s drink, it tasted almost like bubblegum. i can see how someone would say it tasted medicine like but i think that’s a slight exaggeration. overall i rate this one a 7/10, not bad but wouldn’t order again. 

for the peach passion fruit drink, i had low expectations for this one, but it ended up being my favorite! it’s so good! i was pleasantly surprised. the flavor was light and not too overpowering. i would rate this one a 9/10. i’m just worried because i feel like dunkin’ drinks are never made consistently so i don’t want to get this drink again and end up not liking it.

2158,DunkinDonuts,i'm new to cold brew and like blueberries so id thought i'd give this a try. the hint of blueberry flavor was good but the overall combination of the slightly bitters cold brew with oatmilk was a 6/10 for me. i didn't realize this was an unsweetened drink so what should i do next time to get the flavor/sweetness profile up? almond milk? sweet foam? add  a pump or two of vanilla in? looking for tips!,blueberry oat coldbrew?

2161,DunkinDonuts,"as the title says, there’s never enough cold foam on my cold brew, even when i pick it up straight away or order right at the window before it melts as they suggest! on the app they say “pick up within 5 minutes for best results” or something like that. even when it melts it doesn’t sweeten my drink enough though. 

so when i ordered today i asked for extra cold foam and they said they can’t do that. i asked if they could just put less coffee and more foam on top? they said they can’t because it’s “measured”. i don’t understand? from what i’ve heard it’s pretty much a spray can? so they really can’t just put less coffee and spray more on top? i don’t even mind if it’s roughly eyed up. just wondering how this works and how this drink is actually made. 

i’ve just been really disappointed in dunk lately. this coffee would taste so much better with a bit more foam to sweeten the taste. i don’t like to add other sugars or syrups and i like the flavor of the cold foam itself a lot. just a vanilla cold brew with extra foam is all i want. :( maybe i need to figure out how to make something like this myself at home? there’s got a to be a way. if starbucks can fill like half a cup with foam in their “cloud” drink i don’t know why dunk can’t give me more than a half inch? i’m not mad or anything, just sad and i don’t understand lol. any advice or explanation would be appreciated so i can understand better. thanks i’m advance!",never enough cold foam.

there were about 6 cars behind me piling onto the street. everyone looked annoyed and one car was turning to leave through the parking lot. i eventually just left and saw the car in front of me was still at the pickup window the whole time.

also what can i expect? this is a dunkin that operates from 5am-7pm inside a gas station. i prefer working evening/nights but i’m not really sure how shifts at a place that closes at 7pm works. also not sure if gas station dunkins are different then regular dunkins. i use to have a friend that worked at dunkin, he seemed to have it easy. his only complaint was the manger was an asshole.

the next in line of authority seems to be the shift leader, but i don't have any of their contact info and i don't think they're the people i should ask when it comes to schedule change requests and things like that? or are they? 

this is like the third time i've posted on this subreddit so i'm really sorry if these are getting annoying lol",who's in charge?
2179,DunkinDonuts,"i go to dunkin once a week, only because i am an hour away from my location.  so when i make the drive to my weekly therapy appointment i always swing by the drive through to get an non dairy  vanilla iced coffee (kudos to the coconut milk addition) and i order a 50 count munchkins with half glazed and just put whatever else in for that half. they are inexpensive &amp; excites my kid and husband both for me to bring them home. 

today was no different but i was only  behind 3 cars in line. but it took a good 20 minutes until i got to order at the speaker. once i got to the speaker there was a sign they were out of like frozen coffee drinks and basically any specialty drinks for the day. then another sign saying they’d be closing early, assuming for the fact they were running low on everything else coffee wise.  (mind you this was like mid afternoon) 

sooooo....i ordered my regular, given the total and drove around. the poor man working the window looked so defeated, just over it all lol he hands me back my card while i was asking how his day had been going since i saw all that signage and he said it was hard more mentally than anything because how rude customers have been toward the specialty the drinks they may want, not being available. i said don’t worry and just take your time. 

y’all

he came back to the window and he handed me two of the 50count munchkins and before i could ask if i messed up and ordered 2x50 c munchkins. this little feller says “mam these are heavy because i packed them full so i gave you 50 count of glazed with plenty extra then the other box packed full of assorted until i couldn’t hardly close the box. “ i told him thank you so much to which he said. “i’m done... i am done with today. oh and.... here’s a dozen donuts.......just for not being a jerk.”





tl;dr

i think a couple days ago the place i work got a new shipment of aprons and shirts and hats so i was given an apron and a visor. 


i was only given one, how often do i need to wash it? i dont have an in home washer so it’s $3 to do laundry and i cant be doing that every day for just an apron and maybe the work shirt if i dont have a different one i can wear. it didnt get super dirty but i definitely got a bit of the liquid cane sugar on it that is visible. would once a week be ok or is that too long apart?

i know this isnt the same for every location (maybe it is??) but how does the employee 50% off thing work. do i need to ring my order up on my own and then apply a discount bc i don’t know how to use the registers yet. watched them be used a few times and had it explained to be but i definitely cant do it on my own yet.

a few months ago, i auditioned for an out-of-state music program and got accepted. then i got hired just this past week. i'd told the hiring manager that i would be unavailable for about the first half of summer break and she said it was okay, but then they switched managers and i don't know if she told the new manager.

so... what should i say to the new manager? they're really nice and understanding, but i don't want to disappoint them or anything like that. i also love the work environment and don't want to lose it. the place i work at is also a bit understaffed and i feel really bad for leaving so abruptly, even though i sort of have to.

2202,DunkinDonuts,"bit of a rant, but i hope you stick around. 

see the new sunrise batch is offering 3x points when you mobile order. perfect. i’ll take an xl with 2 cream 2 butter pecan. send order in as i pull into the dunkin. 

drivethru is 6 cars deep, so i’ll go inside. i walk in and it’s busy; 5 people in line. i head over to the mobile pick up and i’m greeted by what looks to be a manager (this detail is important later.) he finds my slip and begins making my drink. 

i get my coffee and head to my car. as i walk out i notice the coffee doesn’t feel overly warm. whatever, maybe the cup is thick today. get out to my car. take a drink. luke warm would be giving it too much credit. it was room temp. i decided to be “that person” and go back in...

i approach the same guy and politely said, “i hate to do this, but this coffee is nearly cold.”

to which he replied.....wait for it....

“yeah, i was thinking it might be...”

-__-

he then proceeds to remake it with original blend (which i asked for as i was in a hurry) but gave me a l instead of an xl. i didn’t want to cause more issues so i just said thank you, apologized to him, then left.

2208,DunkinDonuts,"i feel like this is a common problem among dunkin locations, but i'm not sure.  i usually go for an iced coffee 3-4 times per week, just with cream and sugar.  what i don't understand is, for a chain that has the exact same recipe for making each drink, how the quality can be so inconsistent from day to day.

&amp;#x200b;

like this week.  i went three times this week, including today.  the other day, i got a small iced with cream and sugar.  it had just the right amount of sweetness, ice and coffee flavor, and it was great.  same thing with the caramel earlier in the week.  delicious.  then, i went again today just for another small with cream and sugar.  today's version of ""iced coffee"" was lukewarm coffee with two or three ice cubes floating on top, rather than the ice being put at the bottom, and it tasted like actual toilet water.  i actually dumped the whole thing out as soon as i got home because i had no cream and sugar in my house to make it palatable.

does anybody else experience this at their locations?  i never can understand why a chain like this is so inconsistent.  there is a location that's slightly farther from my house that is almost always good and consistent, so it doesn't happen at every single location.  but i'm failing to understand why we're paying $3-4, and it's like playing at a casino in vegas, waiting to see whether you'll get a decent cup of coffee or toilet water.  i do have anxiety, which is triggered by fully caffeinated coffee, so i tend to stick with half-caff.  i'm sure the decaf addition does play a role, but even when my anxiety was nonexistent and i got full regular, it was the same thing.",does anyone else get annoyed at how inconsistent the quality of dunkin is each day?

2245,DunkinDonuts,"i was skeptical. i was hesitant. but i was willing. 

i do not have luck with dunkin’ swirls. a lot of them have a strange aftertaste to me or something *off* about them. 

i love vanilla, but the vanilla swirl just has this odd twang at the end. the pink velvet was decent enough, but a bit too sweet. 

i tried the butter pecan in an iced coffee with cream. i got 4 pumps. way too much for me. i was not able to enjoy it and became incredulous of the hype. 

this morning i tried 2 swirls in an xl hot coffee. pretty solid. figured i’d give it one more try. 

got a frozen coffee after work (don’t judge two trips in one day). large frozen coffee with cream and 3 swirls. wowzers. it spoke to me in a language that few can speak. 

tldr - butter pecan is hype worthy, but i find it to be pretty rich and there’s better balance with less pumps. give it a try. i recommend it in a frozen coffee.",butter pecan is worth the hype. a review.

2247,DunkinDonuts,"last night i went to dunkin and it was possibly the worst customer service i’ve ever had. my friend and i pull up to the drive thru, and have to wait about 3 minutes until they take our order. there were 2 other cars in front of us. we pull up from the speaker and begin waiting about 10+ minutes to even move from that spot. as we we were waiting, cars began to back out from behind us and we almost did but we decided to wait it out. we finally pull  up to the window after the guy in front of us just drives right past it because he’s so annoyed, and we get our food immediately because all we got was 2 munchkins lol. 
i look inside and only see 2 workers. one has no mask on at all and is yelling at kids in the main lobby to sit down, while the other does all the orders.
wtf. i can sympathize because they were definitely short staffed and if she had to bring her kids to work because she had no one to take care of them, but if it inhibits you from actually doing your job maybe another solution would be better.

2251,DunkinDonuts,"hi everyone :)

i  go through the drive thru and grab a coffee at my local dunkin almost every day on my way to work at around 6:20/6:30am. my dunkin's hours are listed (both on a sticker window and on the app) as opening at 5am every day.

now, multiple times, and only ever on sundays, literally no one is there... it has happened 3 times to me, and once my to brother. always on a sunday, and yes i work weekends.

so my question is, is it worth my time to call someone about this, who would you call and is there a way i could do it anonymously?  the people who are there on sundays are usually different employees i have also noticed. i'm not usually a complainer but only because this has happened multiple times, it's getting a little annoying and some days i worry they won't be open on my way to work, it's just very inconvenient. like you can't just... not show up to work when you're supposed to and continue to get away with it. anyways, thanks in advance for any comments.",local dunkin is not opening on time? should i do anything?
2252,DunkinDonuts,"i honestly love this dunkin to death. their coffee is always fresh and not burnt (another dunkin in my area has always burnt coffee, idk how), and the employees are super nice. they've only gotten my order wrong once and that was today, but they were sooo sweet about it and fixed it in no time (she just handed me the wrong order through the drive thru). the employees there always have the best attitude and are super sweet and that's that's i love most about this dunkin (they also sometimes compliment me when i get my nails done :) ). i went there one day and it started pouring hard, if i would've known that  it was going to rain hard i wouldn't have gotten a certain food item as it usually takes longer so i have to pull up into a parking spot and wait for someone to bring it out (you're not allowed to go inside due to covid). so it was raining super hard but the employee working their brought out my order in the rain and was super polite! i always make sure to tip them when i can! and that's my little dunkin appreciation rant, sorry if it was hard to read im originally from a different country and moved to the us so english is my second language",dunkin in my city

2254,DunkinDonuts,"as a longtime customer (8 years), i love dunkin’ deeply. i get a large iced coffee (dark roast until discontinuation; cold brew isn’t as good as dark roast, despite the same beans, but an espresso shot does help out) with one milk and one sugar. i get black iced coffee if i’m at an artisan shop because it’s better coffee, but dunkin’ is just better with a bit of milk and sugar. i don’t mind that, and dunkin’ is still what i get every morning  (and not because of price point) because it’s more enjoyable to me.

so i like black coffee most of the time, but i get a lil’ milk and sugar at dunkin’. that doesn’t make me a coffee failure or someone who hates coffee, anymore than it does the people who want the dunkin’-determined normal amount of milk and sugar (or cream/sugar) with some flavor pop.

we all know the normal amounts for a particular drink. three of each is standard for a medium iced, four for a large. you add in proportionate flavoring for your taste. we each like our own coffee our own way. 

but for people shaming someone getting a fairly normal drink, what’s your fucking deal? if you’re a coffee snob, go to the starbucks subreddit (as if sbucks doesn’t burn their beans and give bitter, bad coffee half the time unless you pay extra for the good beans with the clover) or to some coffee subreddit where your views will be “appreciated.”

but dunkin’ isn’t about snobbery. as the beautiful, hella accurate and lovable snl skit showed, we are not about snobbery.

2257,DunkinDonuts,"i'm not a coffee drinker. i don't like bitter things and i don't like warm beverages and i don't really like the flavor of coffee in general. however, i recently discovered the chocolate stout cold brew with cold foam and am obsessed. the calorie count and grams of sugar were relatively low (at least compared to starbucks frappuccinos which is the only other coffee beverage i like) and the chocolatey goodness masked the bitterness of the coffee, leaving a pleasant vague coffee flavor. but the drink is now discontinued and o have no idea what to do with myself! 

this post is mostly just to share my sadness about the loss of the chocolate stout cold brew in case anyone else is feeling the same... maybe dunkin management is reading and will reconsider! 

however, i am also interested in any suggestions you might have for a replacement drink that might be similar.

-would you like to try our new vanilla cream donut?

-i don’t want any cream, i want a donut.

-",a conversation between me and a customer today
2259,DunkinDonuts,"what would you have done?

this morning, i decided i’d treat myself and try the butter pecan swirl. i ordered (in the drive thru) a small iced latte with one pump butter pecan swirl.

i get to the window and the guy hands me my receipt. it says two pumps swirl. 
“hey do you know if this was made with one or two pumps? on the receipt it says two.”
“oh yeah, that’s just the swirl! it comes with two.”
“i know, i just asked for one pump tho!”
confused...but hands me the drink and says he doesn’t know how they made it so just try it and see if i like it. it tasted great but was wayyy to sweet so i asked for the one pump. 

so i’m waiting for the drink the be remade (again, in the drive thru) and so he hands me the new one and tells me to try it again to make sure and that he had just made it for me himself. it was filled up so much with ice that i couldn’t even get the straw in. i finally did and it tasted absolutely horrible. he asked how it was. 
“i’m so sorry, but this doesn’t taste right either. it tastes really different than the first one and weak.”
“well actually this is a latte. so it’s different than coffee. it has a milk base and one shot of espresso so it’s not going to taste as strong.” (i get that a lot of ppl probably don’t, but i know what a latte is )
“no i know, it’s just that this hardly has any coffee flavor.”
“oh so do you want me to add another shot of espresso?”

y’all i told him it was fine and he was like i’m so sorry we’re short staffed. (this guy was super nice) he asked again if he could do something and i said no and drove off. i was already anxious about holding up the line but gahh what was i supposed to do in this situation?? since y’all are employees what do you think?

i am 99% sure that the second drink did not have a shot of espresso. but i’m not going to be a smarta** to the guy who just made my drink and tell him there’s no espresso in it. but y’all there was no espresso. especially since there was so much ice, that would’ve made the milk to espresso ratio even less so even a stronger drink. and i realized the reason it even tasted like a hint of coffee was because he used the same cup from the original drink. 

i felt like a diva but at the same time my drink was made wrong twice in a row and now i’m bitter cause i drove away paying $4 for pecan flavored milk 

ps it took me a second to realize where i recognized the flavor but the butter pecan swirl tastes exactly like the caramel brûlée from starbucks 

i have the free trial for panera unlimited so i just went there after but they also made my coffee wrong. i guess i just need to stick to water today lol.",long story...but weird interaction😂

2264,DunkinDonuts,"tldr: is it weird to give a dunkin employee a small gift for going above and beyond at their job?

there's a young man around my age who works at my local dunkin; for all intents and purposes, i'll call him j. my stepdad goes to dunkin almost daily, and he gets along well with j. as a result, j will sometimes slip us a discount or something, just to be nice. today, i asked at the drive thru if the new refreshers were available yet, and the person taking our order said no. j was at the window, and my stepdad mentioned the refresher. j was confused and said they were starting to roll out the new releases today. he asked me which one i wanted, and because i didn't realize he was trying to take my order, i said, like a dumbass, ""oh, uh, i just wanted to try one."" j stepped away and returned a few minutes later with two of the new drinks. i gave him the cash i had in my wallet, but he didn't actually ring up the drinks. this kid made me two drinks bc he didn't know which one i wanted and gave them to us for free. i guess i'm sensitive or something, but i thought it was so sweet of him to do that. i want to thank him, but idk how. my usual way of showing gratitude to someone is by baking them something, but that seems really weird to me? upon thinking about this more, it seems weird that i'm thinking about this so much at all. i guess what i want to know is, 1. is this weird lol, and 2. if you are/were a dunkin employee, did you ever develop a rapport with any of your customers like this? i have anxiety and can't stop worrying about this lol. sorry for the novel, thank you if you've read this far, and thank you extra if you reply.",kinda random but dunkin-related question

2266,DunkinDonuts,i went in the other night for a simple drink. it's late night so it's no traffic in the store. so i expect this to just be in and out. i get there and first off the guy has his hood on while on the job like he's relaxing at home. and at the same time he's talking on the phone thru his earphones. but i ignore it and just tell him my drink. like i don't care if you want to be on your phone as long as you can properly multitask. it's like cab drivers that are always on their phone but that doesn't stop them from doing their job efficiently. but this dude you can clearly see is struggling to focus with the cup in his hand. i wanted one of the new cold foam drinks that comes with the new lids. he basically made an iced latte instead with whip cream and a different lid. i honestly just started heading out the door after that. because at that point you're just disrespecting the customer and i didn't want to waste my money from there on. i got  to this spot a few times every often. but usually it's an older worker there that's less distracted. like i said i don't care if you're on the phone and doing all this extra stuff you shouldn't be doing. but don't let it affect your productivity.,can workers be in their phones while in the job?
2267,DunkinDonuts,"i get it, switching away from the styrofoam cups was supposed to have environmental and health benefits. but i confess, i hate these paper cups. they don't keep my coffee warm if i'm walking in the cold weather, and they don't prevent my hands from getting burned from the coffee temperature itself when i'm handed the cup at the drove thru (they don't seem to give you a protective cardboard sleeve like starbucks). also, they tend to leak, as the lids don't stay secured very well and don't seal well at the seam - very dangerous in the car.

yes, i could bring some kind of reusable cup to solve this issue, but the whole point of dunks to me is getting the coffee on the go, when i don't have the time to make it myself or deal with carrying a travel mug around and having to clean it. like many people, i only buy dunks in the context of a travel situation, and these leaky, poorly insulated cups are just not good for that kind of context.

on a side note, dunkin' used to be significantly less expensive than starbucks, but it seems that difference is getting much smaller.  also, starbucks doesn't tell me ""we don't have dark roast, just midnight roast"" every time i ask for the dark roast, they just give me whatever dark roast they happen to have.  furthermore, i miss the cheddar cheese dunks used to put on turkey sausage breakfast sandwiches.  ok rant over.",the paper cups could use improvement

i also realized i was charged for a cold brew when my ""declined"" order was an iced tea. so, i am wondering if the location is doing sketchy stuff and telling customers their previous order declined.","employee forced me to pay for an old order, that apparently declined...but after looking, it didn't decline."
2273,DunkinDonuts,"hey so i started working at my local dunkin' about two months ago i think. i generally work close, friday through monday, and sometimes i work a little bit in the morning on thursday. so usually anywhere from 20-25 hours a week. which wouldn't be the worst, if i didn't also have school to worry about. trying to juggle my college course load and the job has been stressful to say the least. sometimes i feel like i barely have time to relax. i was basically at a 3.6 gpa last semester before having a job, and now i'm at like a 3.0 this semester.

working my normal shifts truthfully aren't that bad. if i didn't have school, it would be fine. the problem is we're short staffed and people are always calling in and asking for time off so i'm always having to cover for people and coming in early on weekends. i don't get how y'all work morning weekend rushes, i can't. i get overwhelmed when i'm over at the sandwich station, it's just a bunch of parts that move very fast and you can only heat so much stuff at once and it ducking burns. i told my boss i don't like working sandwich station at all and would prefer not to work there, yet every time i'm there in the morning, i'm plopped at sandwich station and i don't have the guts to stand up for myself and say something cause i don't wanna be seen as the person with an attitude. 

and school is over for me in a few weeks, which is nice, but that means i'll probably be getting scheduled more, which i'm not looking forward to. i feel like this job has added nothing but stress into my life and the only reason i still have it is because i desperately needed the money. i dream about quitting and i want to, because it's simply too fast and too overwhelming and too many things that need to be done and me constantly having to clean up the slack of other people. but we're short staffed as it is, i don't want to make things worse by leaving. and i got turned down from three other places before applying here, so i don't even know when i'll be able to find another job if i quit. i'm sorry for ranting and if i may come across as a crybaby, but please don't judge me until you're in my shoes. idk, i'm really conflicted. what do i do/",i kind of want to quit but i'm conflicted

2297,DunkinDonuts,"for the past couple of days, this one customer has given us so much grief. she’s threatened to throw hot coffee on us, has called corporate on our manager. and just has been completely disagreeable. all because we’ve had to buckle down the last two weeks on not steaming anything other than milk (for those who don’t know if you steam anything like cream or coffee it will clog and break our machines). 

she tries everyday to get her cream steamed. i was at the register at drive thru today. and typically work drive thru most days 6am-2pm. our manager was taking orders and she completely went off on him about how she always gets her cream steamed in the morning and that he’s just never there. mind you he’s there everyday from 3am-1pm just about. 

she’s gotten into shouting matches and arguments with just about every employee that works at our location. i don’t know how i’m gonna handle having to deal with her order and attitude much longer.

in the past month i have had 2 issues happen where i was overcharged in the app, onceni was charged 2.75 for a $2 for 10 munchkin box and then another time i ordered a drink and when i arrived they were out and come to find out i can't cancel orders after they are made. so i was offered another drink and not wanting to be a nuisance agreed to the suggestion and left, upon getting home i realized the alternative drink was $2 less than what i paid. 

now granted $2.75 the cumulative amount of money i have been overcharged is a very small amount however its the principal of the matter. each time i have written i get angela giving a very canned response that the info is being passed along to train employees and thanks for notifying them.

2303,DunkinDonuts,"i order coffee from dunkin’ every day and my drink is a large decaf iced macchiato with oat milk and either toasted almond, coconut, or blueberry flavors shot. in person it person it would be a bit different but i don’t leave my house at all so it is what it is.

but the reason i ask how it’s made is some days a cup will get here filled nearly to the top with milk and there will be a maybe one inch layer of espresso maximum. other days it’s more like 60/40 milk/espresso (which is perfect). i guess sometimes it’s 50/50 as well. but more often than not it’s varying degrees of so much milk and an amount of espresso that’s almost never consistent. it also varies in how extremely burnt it often tastes but i’d rather drink it burnt than as 32oz cup of milk. and there’s also actually a pretty alarming frequency to having a caffeinated drink show up despite ordering decaf, as well. 

what’s the process to make that exact drink? are the employees doing something wrong or is it some kind of machine that’s wildly inconsistent/unreliable? i generally don’t complain about it and just drink what i get (unless they give me caffeinated, i strictly can’t have that) but i’d still really like to understand what’s going on.

2304,DunkinDonuts,"hi. i just wanna say that i’m tired of customers not giving us their full attention when they’re ordering. they’re talking on the phone or texting or whatever and it’s hard to understand them because they’re doing other things while ordering and they’re distracted. please finish everything you need to before you order or do it after. it’s so difficult to understand and process the order when you’re doing other things. 

here’s an example of something that happened earlier during my shift. there was a lady who apparently ordered a large coffee with 4 cream, 2 sugar and caramel swirl and i missed the caramel part because she was talking on the phone at the same time. i even asked her right before she paid to confirm her order. i said “4 cream, 2 sugar.” and she just nodded and kept talking on the phone so i told her the total and she paid. a couple mins later we got her the coffee and she tells us that she needed caramel. i missed it. because she was on the phone and barely paid attention.

look im sorry for being or sounding selfish. but when you’re ordering. please give us your full attention. it takes a couple seconds to a few mins at most to order, depending how much you order of course. im not asking for the moon here. i just need to be able to take everyone’s orders correctly so we don’t have issues or complaints later on about their order not correct because of a miscommunication. so give your full attention to dunkin’ employees for the few mins you’re ordering. then when you’re done, do whatever you want. trust me it’ll make things easier for all of us.",a request from a dunkin’ employee

after approximately another three to four minutes of waiting my order was complete. not to get off topic, but i thought that the idea of placing a to go order using the app was so that your order is ready by the time you get to the location, in my case i usually arrive about 10-15 minutes after placing my order, but they never start making it until i physically show up in the lobby.

2326,DunkinDonuts,"around a month ago, lines suddenly got much longer at my local dunkin. my guess is the franchise owner cut down on staff because they’re cheap and don’t want to pay people. but now when the line is out to the street (~12-14 cars), they have a sign up saying the lobby is “temporarily closed.” 

i assume this is so they don’t have to lose an employee working the register, but it means that despite doing a walk-in on the go, i’m having to wait in line anyway, and sometimes i don’t budget the time to do that because i’m ordering on the go (that’s the point of otg!).

""i don't fucking care what it costs you will sell it to me""  
  
  
alrighty then, cue the mc. i tell my manager over the headset ""you heard that right? im charging her for 32 almond milks"" she laughs and says the customer is always right! so the woman gets to the window, normally i would tell them the price before they handed me payment, which was $16 plus tax right now, but she basically threw her credit card at me, i asked if she wanted a receipt and got ""no just my fucking drink"" and that's my story of how i sold a $16 cup of almond milk",malicious compliance - dunkin edition
2349,DunkinDonuts,"it was the 1980s or 90s  when dd had a 'twist' donut that i don't see anywhere anymore.  it was 'cake' type donut with a two part twist, coved in a glaze that would flake off.  fairly dark in color.  maybe a 'maple' derived glaze???  i haven't seen them for years.

not a french cruller, not a glazed twist or a cinnamon twist- more 'cakey', not an 'old fashioned'- but that is getting closer to the density.  not a maple bar.  not a sour cream- but that's getting to the doughiness.  

i could have sworn that after they pulled the donut itself, that there were munchkin donuts with the basic recipe.

they were pretty ugly.  almost like the space rock from 2 years ago, not neat twist .

maybe called a 'cinnamon cruller'?  my dad would get us donuts if we behaved in church- we sat in the car while he got them,

anyone know what they were or who might make one like it now?  driving me nuts.

2351,DunkinDonuts,"i'm an employee and i just need to rant. this new hire ruined my morning. we are already at a location where our equipment is faulty; tickets stop being printed constantly, our register system goes down multiple times a day, someone is always there fixing the oasis machines, etc. it's already chaotic even with competent employees especially during the 8-11 rush. we're also at a location with a ton of foot traffic so we get yelled at by customers multiple times a day even when we didn't do anything wrong and shit like this just gives customers more of an excuse to treat us like garbage. 

we have a new hire who is truly and legitimately terrible. i understand that training can take a while and no one is perfect at first, but she is loud and obnoxious; complicates the tickets by fucking the orders up so someone else has to remake them, not bumping, not making them in order, etc; she hands orders to the wrong customers, and she even refuses to learn how to make certain things. no other new hire i have met has had this much difficulty learning what to do, and none of them have had a bad attitude like this. most of them have at least the drinks and the order system down pat by their second day and do their best to listen to their coworkers.

today she wouldn't even follow the directions posted on the machine when we asked her to make a fucking coolatta, possibly the easiest drink to make at dunkin', during a huge rush. she actually argued with us about it because we kept telling her the tickets need to be made in the order that they arrived. put x pumps of syrup into the blender cup, stick it in the machine, press 3 buttons. the directions are right fucking there. jesus. yet she tries to perform other tasks that she doesn't know how to do yet without asking, so today as a result 3 coffee machines were not working for 10 mins during the biggest rush of the day because she didn't even put the fucking filter or coffee in there before pressing brew and did not ask for help. she is also constantly in the way wiping the counters down or asking everyone stupid questions when we have literally 20 customers standing around waiting for their coffee/food. when i say stupid questions, i mean she goes back into the kitchen to ask them where the food is when they are clearly hustling as fast as they can to get the orders out, they have worked at dd for way longer than her, and she doesn't even know how to make hash browns. she is constantly eating and drinking in front of the customers, and i watched her over-20 yr old ass squirt whipped cream into a half full cup of coffee multiple times and drink it in front of the customers. all while our regional manager was there. she fucked up so many times that the entire morning was a complete disaster, and yes, it was honestly mostly her fault. not to mention some of her behavior was just plain obnoxious. i am not trying to be unfair here, it just really messed up my whole day because my shift was 100% more stressful than usual. i hope our manager notices and fires her, honestly.",new hire is terrible and complicates the entire system

2363,DunkinDonuts,"hello! i'm actually a former dunkin' employee, i quit a little over a week ago. i'd been having some issues for a while with the way my manager was running our store when it comes to safety and a lot of hypocrisy in his actions, which i'll get into now. some of my issues with said manager include:

* *glove wearing*: when making anything at our sandwich station, my manager only uses one glove and *reuses* this singular glove over and over for as long as he can until it's seriously worn out or too greasy to a point where it would be noticeable on customers' food. he enforces glove reusing for everyone at the store. this is obviously a safety/health hazard which i had brought up multiple times, and since he knew that i used *two* gloves and changed gloves between tasks which is protocol, he always did everything in his power to make sure that i was never on sandwich station, even if everyone else on the floor was busy and food needed to be made. super upsetting how much he valued saving a few cents for gloves over the health and safety of customers.
* *covid shitshow:* my manager is a complete hypocrite when it comes to covid. he claims to care about covid and the risks associated with it, however, he and my coworkers *never* wear their masks properly. no social distancing is enforced whatsoever. he always invites random friends or family back behind the counter who also *do not* wear masks or social distance, which made me feel extremely uncomfortable. in addition, a lot of customers who come into our store often are not wearing any type of face covering and do not distance themselves from other customers, which he doesn't care about. i was required to serve people who didn't follow the rules. however, our bathroom is closed and has been closed for as long as i had worked there, which he continuously lied to customers about, saying that it is ""due to covid"" when in reality he's simply too lazy to have anyone clean it. i got in trouble for even letting people who were having emergencies/pregnant women, etc. use the bathroom. i actually got covid around new years, and after my initial positive test, my doctor advised that i do not get tested again, and that i should just complete the required quarantine and return to work if i was asymptomatic--since according to them, covid tests could still show up positive up to 90 days after an initial positive test even if you are actually negative. (i am a minor btw)--my manager made me get another test, of course, because of ""the risk"".
* *lack of transparency and consistency*: i'm not sure if this is common (hopefully not), but there was a severe lack of honesty/transparency and consistency when it came to drinks at my store. if we did not have any decaf brewed and someone ordered it, my manager would instruct us to just serve people original blend instead. i recognize that this could seriously harm people if they might be sensitive to caffeine, have health issues, etc.. so i would always make small batches of decaf anyway and get in trouble for it?? huh???? yeah, i'm definitely the one in the wrong for valuing customer's health and giving them what they paid for. dickhead. anyway, aside from this, cups would consistently, purposely not be filled to the top, and when we were nearly out of a swirl/shot/addition, he'd simply eyeball in order to avoid wasting even one single drop. talk about cheap?? customers would end up with barely any of what they ordered, or way too much.
* *reusing cups/wraps/bags:* if someone made an order wrong or someone never picked up an order or something like this, my manager enforced that cups be reused along with bags and sandwich wraps etc. this can be a serious issue if a customer might have allergies, and it's also just plain gross? who the fuck wants to be served someone else's used cup or crumpled wrap? again, the pattern of wanting so desperately to save a few cents over health and consistency.
* *got mad at me for how clean i kept things behind the counter:* what...?
* *communication:* never put orders into the register to print out labels correctly, valuing speed over precision/accuracy. this led to orders being made wrong and things being sent back, backing us up even more which was just horrid if we were busy. also got mad if i asked for clarification, since he often put things into the register without the customer even finishing what they were saying.
* *scheduling me for unapproved hours and getting mad when i couldn't stay longer with a snap of his fingers, even though i'm literally a 16 year old minor:* self explanatory.
* *generally being annoying and rude as fuck:* since my manager knew that i would *actually* follow protocol and not go along with the bullshit penny-pinching hazardous rules he made up, he would constantly make sure that he was on the floor and always practically breathing down my neck during my shifts whether i was on register or fulfilling orders, which was extremely irritating. i'm perfectly capable of doing everything my position entails, but he apparently thought i needed extra observation for being such a rebellious worker!!

sorry that this is super long, this post sort of doubles as a rant for me. really needed to get all this off my chest. i actually recently got hired at starbucks! super excited to get started there--but that's a bit of a tangent. the main point of this post is: does anyone have any idea how i could possibly hold my manager accountable for all of his shitty actions and behaviors--like somewhere to file a report or something similar? this list doesn't even encapsulate *all* the shitty things he does as a business owner. he is putting people in danger on the daily, and *someone* needs to finally stand up to him and try to put these things to a stop. i'm hoping it'll be me, even as a former employee.",advice on holding manager accountable?

2381,DunkinDonuts,"i ordered on the app, just got a coffee and selected drive through pickup. i arrived at the dunkin in my town at 730, i wait in line behind about 6 cars or so. 20 minutes go by and only two cars have moved. maybe they're understaffed, maybe its a difficult customer. whatever all i know is i have to be at work in 10 minutes and cannot wait any longer.  i leave the drive through line and go to work. hopeful to just find a simple way to do it on the app. unfortunately i cannot do this, emailed, called, and in the app it says once its placed and charged it cannot be refunded.  


so if say the location had to close, and you already paid. you cannot receive your money or your order. if they are out of what you order its up to the store management to allow you to substitute it. if you get into a accident on the way, you cannot get a refund. every other business that has ordering ahead will refund your money if you do not get the product. if you prepay for a pizza delivery and never get it. (car breakdown, staff walkout, ran out of stock ect) you have a easy option to get your money back. so really there is more of a decentive than advantage to using the app. since often ordering at the drive through is the same wait time, and if the line doesn't move you are out of your money. the only advantage is the rewards.  
im disputing the charge on my card, maybe im a karen. probably but im really upset that they expect me to pay the same price for a drink ahead, all whilst selling my data.

2427,DunkinDonuts,"these things are so damn good, i was buying them a couple times a day. but at $5+ for a large (and, like most restaurants and shops, it's 99% ice when you order it), i decided i needed to make them at home, too to save a bit. i was unable to really find a recipe online, so i just asked them how they're made when i was in the store one time last month.

basically, you just need the sweetened matcha powder (i buy the [jade leaf organic latte mix on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b089q9xd2t/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=utf8&amp;psc=1)) and your choice of milk. having messed with the mix a bunch, i've found that the closest i've gotten is 2 1/2 scoops of the powdered mix, blended with 32oz of whole milk. obviously dunks would use a different sweetened blend, but in my own personal taste test, this is almost perfect.

somebody i know told me that they worked at dunkin’ and that ordering decaf doesn’t necessarily mean you’re getting it. they said the employees used to flip the decaf and regular signs around all the time and didn’t care at all. that, and a number of people have told me that dunkin’ has the highest caffeine content by far of any fast food coffee. not sure where they got that from but based on how it makes me feel, i believe it.

part 2: today i gave into the “what flavor” question and went for vanilla bean. the texture is like ice chips, like a snow cone. i came home and blended it more, but it didn’t really help much. and the flavor is basically nothing. no sweetness to it at all. maybe not enough pumps of vanilla? it’s just kinda..gross and bland and not worthy of drinking.

2484,DunkinDonuts,"the dunkin’ stores in my area only have sweetened and extra creamy. it’s unfortunate because unsweetened almond milk is so much healthier/fewer calories, as is regular unsweetened oat milk. i also don’t have much of a sweet tooth, so it tastes better as well.

it’s difficult to find a way to drink an iced macchiato without it being like drinking a meal, i guess is what i’m getting at. i can’t have lactose, so my only choices are almond and oat. i love the taste of the oat milk (much more than the almond) and i only ever get unsweetened flavor shots, but as far as i know it’s a lot of this sweet and/or creamy milk in the drinks that’s the worst part in terms of nutrition.

is this a universal thing at dunkin’ or store specific? anyone else have anything besides those options? we only have the almond, oat, and whole or skim milk in my area. no soy or any other substitutes.

oh and yes, i’m aware of the americano but that tastes like burnt espresso and tap water. :o",does your dunkin’ used sweetened vanilla almond milk and extra creamy oat milk?

2487,DunkinDonuts,"the chocolate stout is this nice deep rich dark chocolate flavor while the cold foam is thick and smooth foam with very sweet vanilla taste that cascades slowly into the drink.

you can either sip away at it to get some foam and brew in every sip or leave it to rest and let the foam do it's work as time takes it course (had to do this because my dunkin doesn't have the sip lids yet.)

i can see what they meant by dairy substitute, do not be afraid and panic buy it with cream or dairy, or recoil in disgust if you get handed a completely black drink. the foam naturally lightens up the coffee over time.

i'm curious how the cold foam will pair with iced coffees or maybe cold espresso beverages (finally some iced cappuccino foam? ). i'm excited to experiment with the chocolate stout swirl too.",vouching in; cold foam chocolate stout is pretty damn good.

2516,DunkinDonuts,"i can't sleep, so i'm making an in-depth guide to ordering at dunkin. i'm probably missing some things, but this is already a massive undertaking.

now, i'm not the one to say that dunkin never fucks up. having worked there, i've messed up a few orders, misheard people, etc. listen, we're overworked and underpaid. depending on the location, we are moving nonstop for 6-9 hours every day. things tend to blend together. we have a routine.

here's a few tips on getting your order correct (almost) every time in the most efficient way possible.

1. **2-3-4-5** 

most dunkin regulars know this one. if you want a regular amount of cream and a regular amount of sugar, you will get 2 for both cream and sugar on a small, 3 for a medium, 4 for a large, and 5 for an x-large.

instead of saying *""one large hot coffee with cream and sugar.""*, say *""one large hot coffee with 4 cream and 4 sugar.""* some new or bonehead employees will just click the cream and sugar button once, but specifying the specific amount of each will not leave your order up for interpretation.

2. ""**light and sweet"" vs ""light \_\_\_""**

if you like your coffee extra light (creamy) and sweet, dunkin is adding +1 of both cream and sugar to your drink. saying ""small black coffee, sweet"", might get you 1, 2, or 3 sugars, depending on the employee. saying ""extra cream and sugar"" should always yield you +1 cream and +1 sugar added to the normal regular amount.

if you want your coffee sweet, or light (with dairy), stick with the 2-3-4-5 number rule while ordering.

if you want your coffee with light (a small amount of) sugar, just think of the size, corresponding number, and -1. 

instead of saying *""one small hot coffee, light cream""*, say *""one small hot coffee, 1 cream"".*

3. **swirls are sweetened, shots are not.**

french vanilla, caramel, mocha and hazelnut are the year round swirl flavors at every dunkin. the swirls are thick, sweetened syrup. each 1 pump of swirl is as sweet as 1 sugar.

sugar free vanilla, hazelnut, blueberry, raspberry, toasted almond and coconut (at most locations) are the year round shot flavors. the shots are liquidy, sugar free flavorings. if you order a flavor shot, and don't order additional sugar to it, your drink will not be sweet.

note: hazelnut and vanilla come in both swirl and shot. to differentiate if you want your flavoring sweet or not, just specify if you want the shot or swirl.

instead of saying *""one medium vanilla iced coffee""*, say *""one medium iced coffee with 3 vanilla shots""*. if you really want to get the point across, you can say *""one medium iced coffee with 3 vanilla shots, unsweetened""*.

4. **avoid words/phrases that are up for interpretation**

*""large hot coffee with a lot of sugar""* how much is a lot to you? *""large coffee with a little bit of sugar""* how much is a little to you? *""large coffee with some sugar""* some as in a little or a regular amount? *""large hot coffee""* with what in it? *""large iced decaf""* decaf iced tea or iced coffee? 

we can't read your mind.  


5. **put your order in optimal sequence** (you don't have to do this)

if you wanna really help us out, you can sequence your order in the way in which the employee hits the buttons.  
size  
temperature  
blend  
number of creams  
number of sugars  
number of swirls/shots

*""one medium hot explorer blend with 2 creams and 5 sugars and 4 blueberry shots""*

6. **take an extra second to check the sticker before leaving**

the sticker tells you exactly how the order was made and put in the system. if you want a regular amount of cream and sugar, your ticket will say ""reg crm&amp;sug"" if you ordered light and sweet or extra cream and extra sugar, your ticket will say ""extra crm&amp;sug"" if you ordered a non-regular amount of cream or sugar, or just one or the other, there will be a number next to the addition. ""3 sugar""

the number next to the swirls and shots normally indicates how many pumps are in it. this is different at literally every dunkin. but officially, if you ordered a regular amount of caramel swirl, your ticket will say ""carml swrl"" or ""# carml swrl"". if you ordered a non-regular amount of caramel swirl, your ticket will say ""carml swrl # less/extra swrl"" or ""# carml swirl""  


if i missed any essential ordering tips, let me know and i'll edit it throughout tomorrow.

  
**general tips.**

1. turn off your music in your car! 
2. get off the phone
3. if your engine is loud, turn it off
4. have your payment prepared before you get to the window.
5. don't talk through your mask at the speaker
6. please don't scream at the speaker
7. roll your window all the way down, talk in the direction of the speaker
8. many dunkins do not get more donuts throughout the day. some re-up. some make them themselves.
9. many dunkins do not make any of their baked goods in-house. some do a few, some do it all.
10. if you don't like how the sugar in the iced coffee always settles at the bottom, ask for liquid sugar instead.
11. if you order a donut on the app, it does not tell us which donut you ordered. it just says ""donut"". we will have to ask you which donut you got once you get to the window.
12. the app also does not know which donuts we have left or if we've run out of items.
13. often, we will have seasonal swirls before and after their release and end dates. just ask.
14. if you hear the latte steamer through the speaker, speak louder because that thing is deafening. 
15. dairy products (such as cream, milk, and skim) come out of a dispensing machine as 1-5 tablespoons. oat and almond milk is eyeballed and estimated.
16. most of the time, employees will shake/swirl drinks instead of stirring them with a spoon for time efficiency. if you're picky about the distribution of your sugar/swirls, ask them to stir it with a spoon when you order.
17. some locations don't have an automatic sugar dispenser, instead they have a teaspoon and a bowl of sugar. each employee spoons their sugar differently, so it may vary. 
18. we don't have a microwave, just a speed-oven
19. if you ask for less ice in a latte, you're getting more milk. never more espresso.
20. lattes have one shot of espresso and are stirred. macchiatos have a double shot and are not stirred.
21. iced cappuccinos aren't foamed in a steamer. they're blended using the oasis machine.
22. cappuccinos have overall less milk than lattes and macchs. it will be very light weight-wise.
23. we can't steam cream.
24. if you order on the app, some franchises will make it right away before you get to the drive thu, some shops will wait to make it until you get there.
25. swirls contain dairy in the syrup!
26. lattes already contain mostly milk. you don't have to order it with ""cream and sugar"".
27. lattes, macchs, and capps do not come sweet unless you add sugar or swirls to them.
28. signature lattes are the same as regular lattes with swirl, but they have whipped cream and toppings on them. it's cheaper to order a flavored latte and pay for extra whip.
29. oat/almond milk is an upcharge.
30. sometimes we premake espresso shots and they'll sit for some time before being used in a drink.
31. matcha powder contains a shocking amount of lead. don't drink it every day.
32. not all locations have cold brews and cold coffees on the taps system.

2540,DunkinDonuts,"hi! i just want to say thank you to everyone who works at dunkin, especially now. i know i could not handle it and i want to rant a little about my experience today and use it as a reminder that you all are super important to our days whether we as customers show that or not!!!

i went in this morning to pick up a mobile order and it wasn’t ready yet so while i was waiting i just watched what was going on and everyone looked so scared and run down and then i realized there was a new-ish (i’m assuming fairly new) person training and the manager or shift lead was being so mean to them!!! nothing they did was good enough and he kept treating him like he was doing something wrong. at one point a man came in and ordered “a nitro” and the new employee who was on the register asked what size. the manager snapped on him and told him to move and that he would handle the orders. little things like this just kept happening where clearly the new employee was trying to learn and asking logical questions and the manager clearly had no patience. it just made me so upset and i can’t get over it! it was pretty clear this manager just did not appreciate his team at all because the atmosphere in the store was so tense, even i was scared of this guy!!!

anyway, i know what it’s like to work for a terrible boss and not get any appreciation from management or customers so just wanted to thank you all sincerely and let you know that you are important! ️",just venting &amp; a big thanks!
2541,DunkinDonuts,"not to sound snobby or rude but that sounds like a ridiculously unhealthy and american thing to do.

i wonder if people know that the swirl is a **pre-sweetened high fructose corn syrup** flavoring. so one of the sweetest things in existence.

by no means am i sensitive to sweetness either, i have a fair share of a sweet tooth, probably more than i'd like, but even a pump extra than the typical (2 small-3 medium-4 large) feels excessively sweet to me.

then people get liquid/sugar and cream on top!? how do you taste any coffee and anything except milky sugar at that point?",do people seriously get sugar and/or cream on top of swirls?

2545,DunkinDonuts,"so, officially, we can’t add espresso to the extra charged drinks, or make espresso drinks extra charged. it’s a liability issue, because the last thing we need is to give someone a damn heart attack. 

apparently from what i hear, some of our stores locally are pretty lenient on that, but at our store at least we’re very firm on that, usually with the explanation of it being a liability, and most are understanding. 

so i couldn’t help but laugh earlier when my manager was taking orders, explained that to a customer, so the customer was like... okay, so i’d like to get an extra charged coffee, and also in a separate cup can i get a double espresso? manager kinda just rolled their eyes and still rang it up, though i made it a point to fill the cup all the way up with coffee so at the very least she’d have to drink some before adding the espresso. 

i mean, i can’t personally judge—in a single shift
i usually go through two monsters and at least one extra charged drink, because i have a caffeine addiction, but i also have been that way for a long time and know my limits, and i can’t say the same for knowing whatever rando that comes through our window.

so i think that this is just at my dunkin’ donuts but the baristas there never follow your order, just today i order a small iced coffee with 2 shots of milk, and 1 swirl of carmel, i also ordered a croissant with light butter. 

when i got my order on the label, the croissant was marked with extra butter! and my drink had 6 shots of milk and 4 swirls of carmel, and way to sweet for me. 

i went back to the counter, and a told them, and they said that’s what i asked more, i showed them my mobile order, and then they said that they can’t do anything about it , and that i would just have to live with it.... 

i was shocked. i am usually not this way but i asked for the supervisor ( i have never done that before). 

he came out and i explain the situation, and right away the employe said

2618,DunkinDonuts,so i'm pretty sure i'm in the absolute minority here but i am obsessed with the sugarplum swirl. some of my local stores still have it but idk when it actually ends (i thought it ended already) i've seen on posts here that some stores will sell the syrup and swirls... none of the ones i've been to will. i've begged. i've tried doing a starbucks hack and asking for 50 pumps in a cup of ice no ice to redeem the free drink lol but obv the app wont do that and neither will any of the employees - like literally everyone here is stingy af - one store wanted to charge like 35 cents a pump over the standard (3or4) even when the app gives up to 10. not to mention i can't even access sugarplum on the app anymore so i have to ask everywhere i go. i digress. i need this sugarplum in my life so i'm coming to you guys to ask if you have any hacks or suggestions on how/where to get it other than spending $60 on ebay because that's absurd. i'm in central florida.,sugarplum dreams...
2619,DunkinDonuts,"i ordered an iced latte between my day job and night job this afternoon, and i ended up with something different than i ordered. not unusual for dunkin’ obviously, and it was still drinkable so i just drank it and went on with my day.

when i actually looked at my cup, i realized the label with my order had been meticulously placed (seemingly intentional) over another order label. i thought that’s a bit weird, giving me a drink that was obviously intended for another customer that was mistakenly made or whatever. but then i really thought about it and realized how ballsy (and dangerous?) of them to do this because god forbid someone is allergic to certain milks/ingredients.

but here's my question, i know inside they have a tip jar for cash but i usually use the drive-thru and there's no tip jar there, as well as no way to add a tip with my card.  is there a way to tip through the app or is dunkin just not a huge tipping establishment? i've been doing the survey whenever i get my receipt and try to make a note of the employees name if i see it to make it a bit more personal but i wasn't sure if there was a different way i could be tipping them?

also, side note, is there a benefit to paying through the app? i usually just scan through the app and pay with my credit card separately.

i just had my interview today and i’m pretty sure i’ll be hired. as a teenager still in school i just have one question regarding if dunkin’ donuts has lockers to store items in. i had told them my availability and i’d be coming from school but i forgot to ask if there would be a place to store things like backpacks and coats. 

looking at my calendar now i had just realized saturday off and working on sunday from 7-12 would be more beneficial for me rather than working both saturday and sunday at 2-7. is informing them about my sudden change of mind bad? i’m worried because i’m in the process of being hired and i have to fill out a few forms online but i had already filled out an application in person and put my availability for both saturday and sunday from 2-7.

the person called and was super upset/chewing us out, i apologized and offered to refund if they come in but they weren’t satisfied with that. how would you guys handle this situation? i don’t really see how we are supposed to know, we’re not required to know how other apps work..",delivery order foods not warmed?

just a quick question. i was browsing the shift marketplace for labor day week and i saw a lovely 7:15-2:15 shift available. without looking much into it, i claimed it! it's at another store, and it wasn't until after i claimed it that i realized that it is partial coverage and partial training. i'm not a trainer, so i can't train anyone, but i'm also definitely not a green bean, so i don't need training. so... this shift feels like something i can't do. who can i talk to in order to fix this?",accidentally acquired training shift
2658,starbucks,we had a long store meeting today where we talked about concerns and stuff like that. i mentioned how we shouldn’t always say yes to customers because certain requests are against the standards and can make things harder for other partners and stores. our dm tells me to stop and just do what the customer asks me to because it’s “easier.” what do you think of this?,is this okay?
2659,starbucks,"the way customers interact in the drive thru drives me nuts. i hate having to play 20 questions on dto. 
customer: i want strawberry açaí 
me: what size? 
customer: venti 
me: with water or lemonade? 
customer: make it with whatever it usually comes with
me: it can come with either one 
customer: lemonade then 

just a tip to customers. whenever you order always order with the size first and if it’s hot or iced. 
good example: i would like a venti iced caramel macchiato
bad example: i would like a caramel macchiato 

you can even say small, medium, or large, we know what you mean. do not say “regular size”. 

at the window, do not wait until i have handed you all of your items to ask for things. if we are waiting on something or even when i take your payment, ask then. this includes straws, napkins, cream, sugar, stoppers, sleeves, bag, cup of water. it’s a massive waste of time. 
 
baristas aren’t technically allowed to offer straws for drinks that do not require one as our cups are literally meant to be used without a straw. 

it’s very frustrating when i’m doing solo dt and a customer is waiting on their drink and waits for me to hand it to them to ask for a straw. i am already slower as i’m solo but it slows me down even more when people do that. on top of that, just ask for everything you want. don’t wait for me to come back with your cream to ask for another thing and then rinse repeat.

2660,starbucks,"if you come to the front door and discover it to be locked, and after checking the hours, you realize the store is closed, there is a 99.99% chance that the side door will also be locked. the number of customers that walk around the side of our building to try and enter through the side door is mind-blowing.",a crazy idea
2661,starbucks,"so. to start things out. my last shift, i took food home as the sm said it was okay. my huge fuckup here is that i think i put aside food like, 15 minutes before we actually closed, and a partner might've seen me do so (even though.. others were too and such.)

(like from the 12th onwards). i'm sick to my stomach and freaking out pretty bad. i haven't gotten any sort of notice from my manager, and my profile says it's still active, but could it be that i'm terminated and they put in my 2 weeks??",did.. i get fired/terminated? paranoid after doing something wrong + schedule app change

2664,starbucks,"tomorrow is my last day and all of these are purely based off of my 2 years here. 

1. absorb as much as you can from your training and never be afraid to ask for help.

2. try out other brands of espresso, starbucks isn't that good tbh.

3. its not a bad thing if you're not always on bar. others need a turn and you might just aide your team better somewhere else.

4. we are a team. not everyone gets along but try to support your team as much as you can. it makes for an easier shift. 

5. be kind to your openers, odds are they have the highest traffic hours. this is a coffee shop.

6. your closers want to know what you need to open. they don't need to know every little thing that was wrong.

7. if you're opening, fully prep and stock everything you can think of. it can turn your whole shift around.

8. do not live and die for this job. it can be fun but its a job. your joints and bones are not worth the wear and tear. 

9. if you're a high schooler be respectful of your full time partners. this job is their livelihood and not always a fun place for you to chitchat and play around in. 

10. stores that gossip all the time are not worth the hassle.

11. grow a thick skin. the things customers say and do to us can be vile and rude. i promise holding on to any of it will hurt more than you need. 

12. find your regulars, these customers will be the best you have ever known and are more than worth the trouble of others. 

13. unionize. your managers are more often than not, not a good source of information about unions and cooperate does not care about us 

14. do not be afraid to speak up against your shifts to your manager if something wrong is happening. your concerns deserve to be heard

15. enjoy it. starbucks is a rush like no other.

2667,starbucks,"in the middle of peak i'm dumbfounded by a reaction a customer of mine had. she ordered a venti caramel frappuccino with 6 shots. i pulled the shots directly into the cup, pumped 4 frap roast, and there was barely room for 1/4"" of whole milk. she saw me struggle with the whip and scrape it off once because the drink came over the top and i wasn't able to put the lid on (our whips were like frozen today and acting crazy) and there was a bit left in the blender but not much more than typical with some venti fraps. the excess got dumped as per usual. 

well she didn't like that, but first started out by asking ""is there 6 shots in this?""

""yes""

""and that's 6 more shots than like what the 2 or so already in it""

""no, typically this drink doesn't have any espresso, this was 6 total shots and 4 pumps frap roast""

""oh, well you did you throw away the rest usually there's more left""

""...yes""

"" and he yells"" no! the same drink but in a tall!"" so making sure i wasn't getting anything wrong i ask ""you want two? one in a venti one in a tall?"" he screams yes and drives off too the window.

admittedly it was only two partners on the floor and we ran out of vsc for his vscc so  after i make the vsc i go to the window and tell him his total. he just looks at me with his phone and says nothing. i ask him ""apple pay?

at that point i close the window in his face and turned around to ask someone else to handle it.

2686,starbucks,"dear starbucks and howie - you are slowly killing all things that starbucks was and all things they stood for.  do you know how many baristas cry on a daily basis at work?  probably not, they have to hide in the bathrooms/backrooms to make sure your ""third place"" is always intact.  do you know how many of your ""partners"" have anxiety attacks on a daily basis about work, having to come to work, or how they will afford to live?  probably not - most of them hide/mask this for fear of losing their jobs.  starbucks used to be a place that empowered their managers to go above and beyond for their partners - and now you have turned them into micro-managing robots ( of course there will always be exceptions) that have little to no outlets to spread joy to their partners.  

this is the reason i left - this is the reason you are losing great partners, this is the reason your partners want to unionize.  they do not feel like parnters.

you have stripped their will to pour their hearts unto their jobs, you have run them ragged by not providing enough coverage hours to do their jobs in a way that would make them and customers happy.

unfortunately you have made this only about money and power.  its truly sad.  i wish i could hug all the partners that put their heart into their work and never see a return.

2687,starbucks,"the good ol' shaken espresso with no ice bullshit. we have a new regular who has been ordering this drink. venti shaken espresso, no ice, no classic, with almond milk. naturally when i arrived at this drink while bar supporting i told the baristas to let me know when this person showed up so i could explain that this drink isn't meant to be made this way. the baristas informed me that this regular is deaf and they have a hard time communicating with them so all of them have just been making a venti iced quad latte with no ice, essentially. 

today i got the mobile order again so i wrote on the cup ""this needs to be ordered as a latte, thanks."" i genuinely am not trying to be rude, i just want them to get what they want and understand that a shaken espresso is not what they are actually ordering. i'm not sure what will happen next or if they even noticed the note however i'm not going to give someone special treatment just because they are deaf/hard of hearing. actually i find it quite rude when someone acts entitled because of a disability. i try extremely hard to treat everyone the same, equally, no matter who they are or how i feel about them (if i know them well). everyone deserves to be treated fairly. i feel as though it is not fair to give this one person a pass just because they aren't willing to try and communicate with us.

that being said, i'm not sure if anyone has ever actually explained to them that this drink cannot be shaken and *is,* in fact, an iced latte. i guess we'll see. i have not checked the price difference on a venti shaken espresso vs a venti iced quad latte. i don't know what the correct way to go about this is, i'm just hoping maybe next time i can actually talk with her somehow to help clarify what these drinks are so that she can order exactly what she wants.

what would you do in this situation? am i wrong for writing a note on her drink? was i rude and/or inconsiderate? i truly don't mean to be however i've been second guessing my decision to write on her cup and i think i could have worded a little better. i'm open to suggestions and constructive criticism. give it to me.",shaken espresso with no ice struggle

however, keep reading and you will see it says, roughly, “this does not apply to unionized stores. by federal law, we must negotiate *everything* with the union first.”

for one, it was just determined federally to be illegal to not give unionized stores the $15 minimum raise. now they’re insinuating that unionized stores cannot have *more lax* policies implemented.

this is a really obvious attempt to make unionizing look bad to us. “wow, union stores don’t get all the good things the company wants to give us!” very desperate tactic to dissuade unionization.

think about it. this was the company with the 80 page “lookbook”, the rigid dress code that cannot clash with the green apron. now i can stroll into my job wearing neon green. that is so out of character for this company. so much so, i thought there must be some misunderstanding.

recent post about sugar addiction made me look up the sugar for my favorite drink-venti chai frappucino and while i get it with soy and no whip, i would bet that it's still pretty close to the 57 g of sugar posted for the standard recipe. i then looked up the iced chai latter and it's even more sugar at 61g for the venti. i get the chai frap 3-4x/wk fyi

can someone explain how that works? someone else kindly answered in another post that sugar is pre-added to the chai mix which explains a lot. is there another syrup added or is the ""chai mix"" just chai and sugar?

any suggestions on less sugary drinks i would like based on my taste preferences?

2702,starbucks,"i work mornings at 4am and constantly i'm placed in the drive-through, doing both dto and dtr. i liked it in the beginning, but the morning shifts put me there all the time and it's burnt me out too many times--no one at my store likes the drive-through and it's only green beans who are placed there. 

i was placed on dto/dtr today and noticed that the times were unusually high--i checked and saw that i was waiting on a few food items for the car at the window. everyone was occupied and i asked a few times on headset if the food was ready, but i didn't get a response. so i left my area at the drive-thru and walked to warming, which one of my coworkers who is a shift supervisor (but wasn't the ""keyholder"" at the time, if that makes sense) immediately yelled at me in front of my other coworkers, saying ""can't you just wait at your position. do you know you're not supposed to leave? you're really stressing me out"", and immediately i apologized because it wasn't my intention. 

i don't know but i feel humiliated in some way. previously there were multiple times where her coaching seemed a bit pretentious. she'd start her comments with ""can you please \[...\]"" or ""you're supposed to know this/that"". i accepted it in the beginning because i was a new barista, but i just can't do this anymore :/ i also don't really know if this is because of starbucks policy or something, but none of the shifts at my store ever work at the drive-thru, they're either on front or customer support. 

i'm always placed at the drive-thru. i'm really starting to despise it, i've asked if i can be switched, and my morning shifts say that it's my only option--that i can do dtr/dto, or both. i'd work in the afternoon since the closing shifts are way more laidback, but i can't because of school. i'm really thinking about putting in my two weeks because honestly this is my last straw ://",a venti rant about a condescending shift supervisor

so i used to work at the starbucks in bullseye and i moved out from it. while i was there, there were no rules against any kind against makeup or hair colour. you could wear lipstick, eyeliner, you could have funky hair, etc.

one of my friends just started working there with their partner, and they just dyed their hair pink and were told it's not allowed for sbux employees and they had to dye it a natural colour. their partner also told me that they weren't allowed to wear any kind of makeup except eyeliner, no lipstick or anything.

is this a new thing, or is this just the bullseye management giving them false info? because they weren't told by the manager for the sbux, they were told by a manager of bullseye.

i feel like saying ""no lipstick"" is really a tad too far for limits on presentation. nail polish? sure. it chips. hair colour? weird, because i don't think anyone's sweating hard enough for the dye to drip into food. lipstick? how is that a food safety hazard?? even if they're all masked (which isn't required for them anymore but they still mask up) they still can't wear it. it baffles me.",question for people who work at starbucks

2717,starbucks,"hi yall i was curious if there's such a thing as a shift trainer. like barista trainer but for shift supervisors. i was trained for my position by my store manager and we haven't hired a brand new shift since i've been there. we've just had people transfer in who had some prior experience as a shift. so i was just wondering if only store managers can train baristas to become shifts, or if it's possible for a shift supervisor to train people to become shift supervisors? i ask because we just had this new shift transfer in and he only had a little experience as a shift, but did all his training already, but my manager had me run a bunch of shifts with him to train him. but it was just me like free wheeling it based on how i know to do the job. it wasn't like i was using modules or anything. and like i said he had done the training so he knew like how cash management and stuff worked, but i was more explaining like when to do what things and like the flow of the store.  


anyways, i really loved training him and i realized i miss training newbies. i've trained like 7 green beans and i almost always love the experience i have with them. 2 of my trainees have become shift supervisors and pretty quickly too. and i'm super proud of both of them. one of them was a gifted almighty natural and took to everything so quick. the other struggled and i coached her and continued to coach her and she got better and better and better. and she always told me what a great teacher i was. she is such a ray of light and i know some of her past and getting that promotion i know meant a lot to her. also, i have to say i love being on more of my own schedule when i'm training. it feels nice to have more control of your time at work.  
anyways now that i'm a shift i know its super rare to have me train new hires. and honestly, the experience i had training a shift this week was really great. i would love to train more people becoming shift supervisors. like i'm thinking the same way the barista trainer system works where we follow along a training plan and the modules and shit. but all i know of is my own experience where my store manager trained me.",are there shift trainers or is that just a store manager thing?

2741,starbucks,"former partner here. i was employed in 2016, promoted in late 2018 until i was separated as a ssv in 2020 without probable cause (hr is no help), returned in 2021 as a barista thinking i could start all over and quit the same year because i realized this life is behind me now. i put off my education because i was so invested in moving up the latter. i only hung out with coworkers and i constantly thought and spoke about starbucks in social settings. my friends that didn’t work for the company found it very annoying.

one year later, i am a different person. i have a 4.0 gpa in college, employed at a local coffee shop making more tips and better hours, and more importantly, my relationship with my close friends that never worked for the bux improved immensely. there are times where i do miss working for the company and the few good customers that made it a positive experience, but i remind myself of how horrible of a time it was while working there. 

my current job, we are required to sign an nda to prevent any sort of workplace hostility such as gossiping about coworkers. i cannot tell you how fantastic it is that i work with people that do not form cliques, talk about each other, and support each other regardless of their skill set on the job. we know we signed a contract and we can get fired if we spoke badly about one another, but it subconsciously influenced us to see the good in each other instead of finding a trait that bothers us towards each other. having a positive work environment without any animosity truly does improve your well-being and mentality overall.

to all the baristas out there, you are all doing a great job. i understand that most people who move up do not deserve to be in the positions they’re in, but try to overcome it and prevent engaging in any sort of negative interactions with other baristas, ssvs, sms and even dms. we all hate the cliques, gossiping, the unsupportive behavior, nepotism, favoritism and horrible customers, but remember you are wonderful as a person. don’t let starbucks consume you and make it your personality, it will hold you back and possibly fall into a depression like i did. go in, do your job, and go home. north star? third place? customer connection? do the bare minimum. the company can care less about you and replace you in an instant, so as i said, don’t let it become you. if you need the job, then stay. if you want to move up, that is also good too, just remember who you are deep down inside. life outside of starbucks is great. i am a lot happier leaving behind the toxicity that was prevalent within the company. you don’t have to be like me and leave to be happy, but i’m just sharing my experience. if you have great partners, a store manager, and district manager, consider yourself lucky because i see that as a rare occurance, cherish it. nevertheless, do what makes you happy regardless. 

have a wonderful day and keep trying your best!",there is life outside of starbucks.

2744,starbucks,"i’m a senior in high school and honestly haven’t worked a single job yet. i was wondering if working as a barista at starbucks would be a good job for me. i’m kind of awkward and struggle with anxiety which is why i think going out and getting a job like this would be good for me and my confidence before i attend college. i still don’t want it to be soul crushing and damaging of course, which is why i’m asking this. 

i’ve seen many people complain about working at starbucks which is why i’m definitely hesitant to apply, (i can understand not liking the job if you work there full time as a career, but i would only temporarily work there) so i was wondering if you think i should go for it? 

also i’d like to mention that i don’t have many options haha , all are fast food (mcdonald’s, dq, etc)  and im a little more attracted to the idea of working in a coffee/boba shop or cafe. the only other option i have is starbucks and even tho it still is technically fast food, it seems much more appealing than working at mcdonald’s",should i work at starbucks for a part-time gig as a highschool student?

the thing is, i never go to starbucks unless it’s with them. i don’t really know any drink other than the mocha frappuccino. another thing is that i drink my coffee black, the complete opposite of them, which means that the drinks i find too sweet for me are not sweet enough for them. so, every time i try to order a new drink for them to try, they don’t like it that much

they like drinks that are reeally sweet and don’t taste too strongly like coffee. they also like caramel and chocolate. and cold drinks, even in winter time. i really want to find something they would like, so what are your favourite sweet drinks? whether it’s on the menu or it’s your own concoction of syrups, i’m not stopping until i find a drink they like",what is your favourite sweet drink?

coworker: chai? umm okay so you wanted an iced almond milk latte with just one shot and with chai? let me remake that for you! 
her: no! i just want one shot of chai! 
coworker: yes, so an iced latte with just one shot and with chai!

coworker: *finally gets what she means* oh! okay let me make that for you! 
her: and throw this out!!!! 
coworker: i actually cannot that for you but there’s a trash behind you! 
then she was flabbergasted that we weren’t allowed to throw out her drink for her &amp; that she had to walk a few steps to the trash can!!!

okay, then food markouts. we get seven food markouts a week. i usually only work four days a week. i've worked three days this week and go in tomorrow, sunday. like i said i usually only get a sandwich or other food item everytime i work. that's three food markouts i've used this week. i should have four left. does that mean tomorrow i can go home with four free food items? and how do i do that? i've bought more than one food item before and when i select ""partner food"", it only applies it to one item then charges me discount price for the other items. on the pos, do i have select each item in the order and apply partner food? or do i have to do separate transactions for each item and apply partner food on each transaction? 

last question (i know i've gone on long)... food markouts on days we're not working. my sm briefly explained it to me when i was hired but i didn't understand fully how it worked. i think she said we can only mark out food on days we work. if we plan to come in on our day off, we could mark out a food for that day. how does that work? for example, i know i will want a blueberry muffin on my day off. do i just mark out a blueberry muffin then come in on my day off and tell the barista working i already marked out a muffin? is there something else i'm missing? how do they know we marked it out? do they check? i can see how that could possibly be abused.",question on food/drink markouts

• venti matcha tea and 3 pumps of vanilla with soy milk substitute
• chai tea with soy milk substitute

i know that starbucks has a white chocolate mocha and i tried a tall once (with only the soy milk as a modification) and although i could tell it was good, i wanted something a bit sweeter and lighter but with caffeine, still.

do you guys have any recommendations? 

pls and thank you!",recommendation wanted pls
2796,starbucks,"i’m positive that this has already been talked about at some point but i really just need to vent right now. 

i was on register and a customer came up to me “do you guys have the marble frappuccino?” i told them no; that it is not on our menu, but if she has a recipe that we can follow, i’ll be happy to send it along to the barista on bar. she proceeded to pull out her phone and show me a tiktok. the video didn’t even have the written recipe, i just literally had to watch the guy make the drink. if i’m remembering correctly, it ended up being a caramel ribbon crunch with cookie crumble, caramel drizzle, mocha drizzle, and whip cream on the top and bottom. i was so beyond annoyed that i had to stand there and watch the video, when the customer could have had the recipe ready to go to read out loud or hand to me to read.

no other restaurant or food place has customers doing stuff like this. 
like imagine going to a restaurant and ordering by showing a tiktok video of a guy making steak and mashed potatoes a specific way. i just can’t with the entitlement. i am completely okay with “out there” orders or complex builds, or whatever. but have the decency to come with the recipe ready to go. she should have sat down, watched the video herself, and wrote down the order for us. 

i remained pleasant and she got her drink made exactly how she wanted it, but this was the first time i’ve had to deal with this. i think in the future, i’ll tell the customer to write it down and then come back to the register. baristas, how do you handle situations like these?",ordering using tiktok videos 🙄

2798,starbucks,"can anyone give me an honest second opinion on how i’m doing, how bad my mistakes are, and what to do with this one supervisor who has a lot of issues with me? i’m afraid i’m in a lot of trouble, and i honestly don’t know what to do at this point. 

i’ve been working at starbucks for about a month and 2 weeks, including training. i’m still struggling a lot. it’s a combination of things that are making me feel behind, but if i had to simplify it then i’d say it’s a mix of subpar training and my natural tendency to be bad at details. 

i trained at a different store because there were a lot of new hires. a lot of the training was online. i was able to practice a bit of cs and p.o.s. and i only got about 2 days on bar. there were a lot of things i was only told or shown once very quickly with little to no practice that i had a hard time remembering. 

i was lucky enough to get retrained for 3 more days after a few weeks of a lot of mistakes, and i feel a lot better with the job. the only issue is that now everyone knows me as an anxious mess so i’m not well respected. some people are nice but others don’t give me the benefit of the doubt anymore. i feel more secure in my knowledge of the job now because i had a chance to ask all my questions, and get told all the rules and terms i didn’t even know existed up until that point. but i’m still working on speed and accuracy. i generally am bad with nit picky details. so even when i know what to do i mess up a lot, particularly on pos. (eg. accidentally charging for milk when you shouldn’t, accidentally scanning rtdne items twice)

so, one of my shifts is really fed up with me. she’s new to the store and is a very detail oriented person. knows how to do her job fairly well since she’s been at it for so long but in my opinion has difficulty with in the moment improvisation, which i feel is equally important. i feel like much of the time things inevitably can go wrong or slower than expected but she typically struggles to adapt to it and gets visibly frustrated. in moments like this she struggles with multitasking and lacks the ability to give clear instructions while she’s doing other things. most people don’t get in any trouble for it because they already know how to do their jobs even without her instruction and have a reputation for being good at what they do already. 

she’s definitely more by the book than my other shifts. she always picks up on the little details i miss and gets really upset with me. sometimes she feels guilty and starts being nice out of nowhere, but ultimately always falls back on getting openly fed up with me for something or another. even off the floor she thinks i’m incompetent and doesn’t trust that i have any common sense. she doubts most things that i say even while we’re having small talk. and hasn’t asked me for permission before keeping me late twice now. whenever something is off i’m the first person she blames for it. i get that sometimes i get anxious and have trouble doing the job completely correctly but she doesn’t respect me as a person. she’s open to other people about how much i hold her back and i feel like if i can’t do my job perfectly in the next few days she’s going to try to get me fired. she openly can’t stand me and looks exasperated just being around me. she’s right to be upset, there are a lot of things she’s had to tell me to do multiple times that i blatantly can’t remember or get right. but i feel completely and utterly disrespected by her in general and i think she truly has a problem with me. 

that said, do shifts have a lot of authority over who gets let go or at least in a lot of trouble? 

if you asked my other coworkers or shifts then they probably wouldn’t think i’m very competent either. but when my other shifts notice me make mistakes they are way more forgiving or able to improvise with it as it happens even if they are frustrated for a second. 

so yeah i keep making small detail oriented mistakes. more examples would be queueing shots before milk.. fumbling with cash.. being slow on cs.. asking if they want sweetener for the wrong drinks… not putting names on every order… 

i understand that my mistakes slow down the rest of the floor and i feel truly remorseful for it. but i feel like no matter how much i try to write down and retain, my inability to be detail oriented always comes around. i can’t stop messing up. and if i don’t get better soon, this lady’s issue with me could get serious. i don’t know what to do.",can this one supervisor who has a serious problem with me get me fired?
2799,starbucks,"for reference, we do sell decaf iced coffee in my region.

lady pulled up and orders a decaf ice coffee. so i explain that we do not sell decaf iced coffee, but we can do a decaf iced americano instead. this is how the conversation went:

me: we can do the iced americano for you instead!

her: is that espresso?

me: yup, it's made with decaf espresso and water, so it tastes just like a coffee.

her: but it's espresso.

me: yup!

her: so it had caffeine 

me: well it has a tiny bit of caffeine, but just like a regular decaf coffee has a little caffeine. but it is decaf.

her: but it's espresso. 

me: yes. 

her: and espresso has caffeine.

me: no, it would be made with decaf espresso. so it is espresso. but it's decaf espresso. so it will be decaf.

her: ...

me: did you want to do that?

her: yeah.

me: what size?

her: tall

me: and anything in that...? sweetener? any kind of milk?

her: light heavy cream.

me: anything else? ^no *total*

then she gets to the window and the bar partner has by mistake made it hot. *remade* then she said is tastes wrong. but won't clarify what tastes wrong about it. then finally the dtr figures out that she's is mad that the heavy cream is mixed in. so we remake is and carefully all pass it to the dtr partner trying not to wiggle it at all so the heavy milk doesn't follow the laws of gravity and mix in. 

she was in our dt for just shy or 13 minutes this morning during our saturday peak. bro. what? i am a very composed partner, but damn. lady had me questioning if i know how words worked anymore. i clearly used the word ""decaf"" 800 times. the dto screen clearly listed a decaf iced americano. what is happening!!!??? excuse me while i bang my head into the counter to make it end. 

bonus story: had someone idle as the dt window for 12 minutes this morning before we opened. car behind him, also waiting for the window, instead of... a parking spot? or even the order box? was there, idling 9 minutes to open, and then one more car at the speaker box 2 minutes to open.

2804,starbucks,"today i got yelled at by the rudest customer ever. i don’t know why starbucks rewards people with this behavior. my coworker took this lady’s order and she got a frap with 6 shots and a sandwich. my coworker told me that she wanted the frap split into to cups. i told her to tell her that our policy doesn’t allow us to do that. the most i can do is give her an empty cup so she can do it herself. my coworker was scared to tell her this and she asked me if i can do it. mind you, this lady is already at the window and starring me down while i make her frap. she was eyeing me the whole time when i poured her frap into the cup and rinsed out the blender. as soon as i opened the window this lady raised her voice and asked me why i dumped the rest of the left over drink that was in the blender down the sink. that i could have used the left over to pour to the second cup. i apologized and said that it is company’s policy that i’m not allowed to split it into two cups, the most i can do is give her an empty cup. she yelled at me and said “well why didn’t you tell me that in the first place! i paid for six shots of espresso!” i told her i’m so sorry but some baristas do not know that policy. she kept yelling and wanted a refund. she snatched the receipt and the pen out of my hand to sign the receipt. i explained that it would take at least 3-5 business days for the money to go back into your card and she went ballistic. i mean a full tantrum. full screaming, full flailing her harms and pounding on the steering wheel saying that she was left with $20 and she needs her money now. i literally told her “ma’am i understand but i don’t appreciate you yelling at me”. she kept interrupting me and kept yelling that she wanted her money back. i understand that she’s frustrated but i am no responsible on your actions of spending 17.01 at starbucks and i am not physically withholding your money. if you are truly broke, you would not stop by at starbucks. her drink alone was around $12. she wanted me to give her cash and she kept asking for a manager. that’s when my store manager stepped in and gave her entire order for free. i didn’t get in trouble. i actually got praised for trying to handle the situation in a calm manner but damn. the after affect of that scream had me shaking. really surprises me how a grown adult can have a tantrum over a cup of coffee.",venti sized rant

1. i like the idea of tea but no matter what i try it’s always too watery and weak. when brewing at home i experimented and got to 1 tea bag per 2oz of water before giving. the only success i’ve had is peach snapple and that’s more like juice. 
2. i’ve found i like starbucks chai lattes if i add an extra pump of chai. i’m interested in trying other tea lattes but i don’t think starbucks has those so that’s not really relevant. 
3. i can’t stand the bitterness of coffee. last fall i tried the apple pie latte (think that’s what it was called) and was optimistic because i love apple stuff but the bitterness off the coffee was too much. i tried a frappe, cookie crumble i think, and i could still taste the coffee too much. honestly tasting the coffee at all will probably be too much. 


with all of this in mind, do any of you have recommendations for caffeinated drinks at starbucks i can try?

also, how terrible are “secret menu” items on baristas? especially interested in hearing from any student workers on here who worked at their college’s starbucks. i know there’s not an actual secret menu so just adding a bunch of stuff. i found some based off the chai drinks that could make for some nice variety but i don’t want to if it’s something that’s a pain in the butt for the person making it.

any advice would be really appreciated. i don’t want to keep buying drinks i can’t stand to finish but really want to find some way to consume caffeine.

when i asked for reminders here and there on the syrups/shots i would get ‘how much did you say? no you’re wrong it’s x amount’. 
if i asked if i was doing steps correctly, all i would get was a deadpan ‘no’ and i’d have to reguess my steps. 
and then sequencing. my brain just could not fathom it for the life of me. so i got the ‘look i really need you to learn this okay sequencing is a big part of the steps’. okay thanks! it’s my first day on bar and you’re training me during a rush. i’m going to screw things up. finished out my drinks and cried in the back a bit haha",being rushed during bar training :(

i as you will see i started working at starbucks 2 weeks ago. so far enjoying it.

i think starbucks is unique in the sense that our menu is very large and extensive and making all the drinks to the desired specifications is sometimes challenging.

i want to build a simulation game in which you can make all the drinks from start to finish—starbucks drinks simulator /studio.

the hot and the cold bar. the steps the works 

i think the existence of such a game will reduce the training time, and resources spent training and will be a quality of life improvement for baristas trying to learn! it will make us learn quickly so we can go through all the recipes and learn more quickly. new recipes can also be added quickly if training can be done quickly.

 if you guys know anyone in corporate who could give me some resources to make this, that would be awesome !!   
i know i am a very low-level person working in the company but i feel like i can help make this training process fun and intuitive. i did this in a day imagine if i get the proper resources to build this complete game how much easy training will be and how fun it will be !!!  

this is just something that i thought of it's okay if you guys don't want to do it lol this i did just for fun!

if you can guys know anyone in the software team that would be really awesome!   
if they want to integrate the above quiz into the ott training and partner platform if they want the source code. i am willing to give that away as well. it would be an honor. i don't have access to it but i have watched videos on it!

2841,starbucks,"i was interviewed for shift supervisor by a manager at a different store than the one i worked at (to remove bias) and he offered me the position at his store. i took his offer and covered a few barista shifts for him before officially starting there on july 11th. he told me that he was going to have me work as a barista until “sometime in august” to get to know the partners and store, an idea that i loved. he said we’d be training every wednesday night. he showed me how to do the pull one night and another night he had me do it alone. since then, nothing. i hardly see him because he’s an opener and i’m a closer. we spoke in person about a week ago and he said that we would “get the ball rolling and it’s going to be quick” he said every saturday night but out of the 3 weeks of scheduling, we’re only doing 1 night.

idk if i’m over thinking this but i heard from another shift that she has seen people being strung along with promises of promotion. they won’t tell me anything else lol. i know i need to speak to him in person face-to-face about my concerns but what exactly should i say? am i being too impatient? i really cannot afford to work as a barista anymore and i would be working somewhere else if i didn’t expect to be promoted to ssv.",promoted or being strung along?

2858,starbucks,"i see a lot of posts about “service dogs” and esas and general pets in starbucks. 

pets and esas are not allowed. 
service dogs are. 

we are allowed to ask two questions; whether the dog is a service dog and what tasks they are trained for aiding in a disability. you cannot ask about the disability (visible or not) and you cannot require the dog to wear a vest or be visibly identified as a service dog, ask them to perform a task, require the handler to present paperwork confirming the dog is a service animal or about their disability (the list goes on and you can read more on the website i linked)

generally, many service dogs will be wearing vests or be visibly identifiable as a service dog. but again, not required. they are also not required to be on a leash only if the tasks they are trained for require the dog to be off leash (ex. getting help if the handler faints or has a medical spell, retrieving items, etc etc). 

please do not get yourself or your store into legal trouble for not following the law. you can legally ask those who are not in control of their dogs to leave, especially if they decide to treat a cafe floor as a restroom. be assertive but try not to escalate the situation.

is it possible the offer letter lists the other location because the manager who’s hiring me is from that location but is hiring for this other location (the one i planned on being at), so she will transfer my account over to this location in the system? or does this mean i’m hired for her location rather than the one i was interviewed at? has anyone here ever been hired by a manager for another location?

2897,starbucks,"my store is very drive heavy, so most of the time when i'm interacting with customers is when i'm on drive thru. often times customers, when they pull up to the window, are on the phone and aren't really looking for conversation. kinda rude, sure, but i can understand. but today i was on front and had a customer come in on the phone, no hello or good morning (barely any acknowledgment that i was there), and immediately hold the phone up to my ear so that i could take the order from the person on the line. all the while in my head i was thinking what is going on right now?? when i was done taking that drink order, the customer just shoved their card into the reader, gave a little smile once the payment went through and walked away. i'm just flabbergasted sometimes by how rude people can be towards food service workers, and i wish that i had the ability in the moment to stand up to them. please don't do this to your baristas, or any customer service workers for that matter, because these kinds of interactions just make shifts so much worse.",put the phone down.
2898,starbucks,"you can always ask the barista or look in the app to see the drink recipe. many drinks have classic syrup in them. you can substitute this with stevia packets, which is what i do. it has a slightly different taste but you can get used to it over time until you won’t notice it or won’t mind it. i love getting my drinks with stevia instead! you can ask the barista to make it with stevia or you can add the stevia yourself later. i recommend adding it yourself until you know how much you like. 

you can also try the drink without sweetener. some of the frappuccino’s, like the matcha creme frap, don’t need any sweetener in my opinion. 

i am not a dietician, but this is what i do to limit the added sugar in my drinks! 

i also usually get nonfat milk instead of whole milk for some drinks, and that makes the drink less calories overall. for frappuccino’s though, they come out too icy with nonfat milk, in my opinion, so i do 2% for frappuccino’s. 

no shame in however you like your drinks but if you do want to reduce sugar or calories, this is what i do, and i still really enjoy my drinks!","regarding the levels of sugar in many popular drinks…if anyone is trying to consume less added sugar in their drinks, here are some quick tips. no shame if you want to enjoy all the sugar though! you do you!"

i’ve been with the company almost 4 years now and i’ve never had any issues with any sm with situations like this up until now.

2911,starbucks,"so over the course of my 2 years the asm has always found a reason to pull me to the back to lecture me and each time has resulted in me ugly crying because when i say i'm doing my best they say my best isn't cutting it. it's usually about 1) not being able to go faster on bar during a rush hour 2) not being able to multi-task dto and dtw and count the change and take someone's order at the same time, or 3) today where i'm not being positive enough?? because customers assume i'm being rude since i'm monotone and have trouble maintaining a high fluid voice?

they always single me out for these things, take me to the back, and think reading starbucks pamphlets to me about our ""mission/values"" will some how make my brain neurotypical or something. like, how is asking a customer, when vanilla is out, ""we're out of vanilla right now, do you want to try caramel instead, or something similar?"" rude??? just because i don't have a woman's voice and can't go high and fluctuate means i'm not being positive? it's such bullshit. and then i also had to spill i have autism and that reading people and normal socializing is incredibly hard for me. now they're going to think i'm stupid or something and need to be babied. 

i've talked to my other co-workers and they say my asm doesn't treat anyone else like this. like if someone breaks a food item they usually let someone have it, but when it's with me they take it and throw it in the trash and go ""sorry, trash goes in the trash. you can't take broken food. you're more than welcome to mark it out though :)""

right after i let my old sm know i was wanting to transfer, they left for another store. they weren't able to transfer me before they left, and them leaving pretty much put my old store into sm purgatory. from the moment they left to until when i moved, we never had a permanent sm. we alternated between being watched over by an asm-in-training, an sm-in-training, and an sm of another store in our district that was training to be dm. despite this, i was assured multiple times that my transfer would be completed in time for me to move. 

that didn't happen, though. to this day, i'm still in the system as working at my old store. i bothered the shit out of everyone i could think of, hoping that *someone* could help me transfer, but to no avail. i was told that since my old store doesn't officially have an sm, no one has ""access""  to transfer me except the dm, who seems either unable or unwilling to.

to make matters worse, the sm at my new store told me that i would start this week but i've only worked two shifts so far and i'm currently not scheduled *at all* for this week, next week, or the week after. my new sm says he'll fix it, but that was a couple of days ago and nothing's changed. i texted him again earlier today and haven't heard anything back.

i'm really fucking stressed about it and don't know what to do. my new store is low-volume and cafe-only, so i'm scared that there just isn't enough room to fit me into the schedule. i'm also scared that my new sm is already sick of dealing with me and doesn't want me to work at his store anymore.

2927,starbucks,"hi, i’ve been officially hired by starbucks since 7/25 of this year, i didn’t begin my actual training until a few weeks later and now this is my final week of training. 

originally, i inquired about getting a job at starbucks because there’s a billion of them everywhere. i was scheduled to move in december of this year, and it would’ve been an easy job to pickup in my new town. now, my move is coming much sooner. my s/o was expecting a move with a new big-girl office job later in the year (december) but now it’s happening in october, before my 3 months are finished at starbucks. 

i was curious what my options are? i’m scared to bring any of this up to my sm or anyone in case of any type of ill-will or retaliation of some sort. my store is very understaffed and several other partners made it clear i was being rushed through training. i also of course do feel bad ditching them so soon especially since everyone there has been incredibly nice to me. idk if starbucks as a corporation will see me as a waste of their time and decide i’m not reliable enough to rehire. 

should i tell my sm about my new life changes? should i put in my 2-weeks a week or two before my 3 months have finished? what issues would this cause for me? would i have to start training all over again at a new store in my new city? would starbucks even hire me again after this?

no wonder it's good. it's loaded with sugar. wtf. i drink iced caramel macchiato every now and then from a similar company which has the same sugar content. apparently the small coffee has like 30+ grams of sugar. what the actual heck. 30 grams is like the daily limit! and i wish i was smarter but when you want a drink you don't really think of googling how much sugar is in it so i never knew. i wish they advertised it more clearly but obviously they wouldn't cause that would hurt sales.

i picked it up and immediately knew something was off. the syrup was sitting at the bottom of the drink, not incorporated at all, and the drink overall just ended up tasting weird. i’m still not sure what it was but it didn’t taste at all like a latte usually does from any other store.

so my question is - should i have just accepted that she wanted to make me a shaken espresso drink? did she *try* to make the espresso drink instead of my latte and it didn’t work out because yknow they’re different drinks? i’m just curious as to what happened to make it so…..bleh. it’s just espresso, milk, ice, and syrup. and unmixed syrup at that. i tried throwing my head back when i drank the first few sips to mix it and it just wasn’t working.

my order has been a caramel frappuccino w/ extra ice, extra caramel, double blended &amp; in a venti cup. 

usually i’ll order and i don’t get any feedback and if i’m at a new starbucks i preface it by saying i have a complicated order just in case. i don’t order if the line is long and i never complain if it’s not in a venti cup. i do not expect the cup to be full. i do expect to be charged for extra caramel. if there was a charge for the cup, i have paid that, too. i work in retail so my ice melts in the back room while i’m assisting guests. the extra ice helps my drink last a while longer. 

today i ordered and after reading back my order, i asked the barista if she heard me ask for a venti cup. it flashed on the screen a couple of times like she couldn’t find the right button, so when she told me to pull up, i didn’t think anything of it. when i get to the window, it’s in a grande cup. i didn’t complain or anything but after reading a bit here i am wondering if that was intentional? 

i don’t want to be a bad customer. can i make this less annoying for them? should i go drop off some chocolates for being annoying? idk??

2986,starbucks,"how long does ethics give decision after the investigation?

this will be a pretty long story/rant. please try to understand as english is not my first language 

2 partners filed an ethics complaint plus 2 incident reports (a witness report and a green bean) against the same ssv.

ssv apparently called a partner from a minority a slave. partner reported the incident to the manager but manager just shrugged the incident off and even told the partner to not tell it to other partners as manager is afraid that other partners will get mad at ssv and will bully ssv. we already knew that this ssv and sm are particularly close and lets ssv gets away from any complaints. instead of giving ssv corrective action or coaching for the racism issue, sm nitpicks on the partner for every little thing even some things aren't true. there was also a second time with the same partner where ssv asked if partner lives on a gh**to area. partner also reported the incident but nothing was done. so we convinced partner to call ethics instead. partner was able to talk to the dm before they moved to another province. partner later found out that our sm called the store sm that they're going to transfer to and said bad things about partner to prevent partner from being accepted to the store.

another ethics complaint and 2 ir are related.
ssv aggressively followed a green bean from inside the store to the parking lot and yelled at green bean in front of many customers and partners which i feel is against third place policy and anti-harassment. even though green bean didn't notify ssv (which ssv is hardly on the floor working) that gb clocked out, ssv should just coach gb properly. gb told the incident to sm but blamed gb instead on how gb is being inconsiderate and non-cooperative. gb told another ssv about what happened and felt it was unfair so they filed a complaint for gb. gb and other witnesses also filed incident reports which notified our sm and it pissed our sm off. the investigation started 2 weeks ago where dm asked people who filed the ir and complaints as well as other baristas.


  many partners also talked to ssv and sm directly on how ssv is being aggressive and acting like a bully to other partners(especially green beans) instead of coaching them properly but nothing happens to ssv instead sm nitpicks/blames partners who complains about ssv and sometimes would cut their hours.


tl;dr 
partners filed ethics complaints and incident reports against the same ssv for racism and being a bully towards green beans. partners tried to have a talk several times with ssv and sm for the aggressive behavior but no corrective action is taken and sm is always covering up ssv.  investigation was started 2-3 weeks ago and partners are losing hope that the results will still fall into ssv's favor. how long will it take till they would release the decision if they're going to transfer the ssv?",ssv who is racist and a bully to partners especially green beans

2999,starbucks,"depending on how liberal you use the word. 2 months may not be considered new to you but i feel like there's still so much for me to learn. one major one being social interactions lol. 

you see that ""lol""? i added that to lighten the *mood* but i really feel like things are getting bad. id consider myself a ugly duckling. wasn't the most pleasing guy to look and the ugly friend of my group when i was younger to being told by men and women i'm really good looking often and all my friends sort of following my lead. all that is cool and all but it causes a lot of unwanted attention for a man who still hasn't left their ugly duck mindset.

it may seems like i'm being braggadocios i apologize if anyone is taking it that way but i'm only pointing this out because i feel like its effecting my work. so as we all know starbucks is a very female dominated brand. from the customers to the staff (at least in my store) i'm starting to have women compliment me a lot. which is so cool because i know a lot of people are shy but i have no idea how to respond without being awkward.

 i don't want to come off as unapproachable but i keep messing these things up dude. a lot of the time i wouldn't mind having a conversation with these folks but i get shy around new people and overthink. i don't want to get fired over this. most of my partners are great people but a select few feel like i'm favored by our manager and critique everything i do. starbucks is supposed to be a social place! my manger is the best she always gives me reassurance but i'm starting to think that's just because she may fancy me (not just based of that, there are other things i don't need to go in detail about)

 i don't want anyone to think i'm unapproachable or stuck up when i'm really just to in my own head. i have a fellow barista who is pretty cute she looks like zoe kravitz who's my celebrity crush. this girl has thrown me so many ""just fucking interact with me you curly headed bastard"" signs and tried sparking conversations and i still overthink saying a simple hi and bye to her

you may read that thinking *""how can you know all this and not be confident enough to converse""* and it comes down to being that guy who would think someone is flirting with him when they were actually doing the complete opposite. i'm not dumb after awhile i can start to tell this isn't just them being nice but id rather deny and be safe then sorry.

i hope this didn't come off too dating advice-ey because at the end of the day my fear comes from losing my job and intimidating others, not loss of possible dates.

ex-partner x2 here. i worked at starbucks 2013-2018, then mar 2021 - oct 2021 before landing (what i thought was) a more stable full time job. 

spoiler alert: it was not.

now i’m thinking about returning to starbucks. i will say, i definitely enjoyed my time during my first five years more than i enjoyed it this last time. with the recipe changes, new policies, covid, it wasn’t my favorite - plus i was starting at an extremely high volume store for our area, and they didn’t really train me again because i’d spent five years with the company previously. (which is whatever, but things had changed, so it would’ve been nice to know them beforehand and not told them while doing something wrong on the floor.)

i don’t think the pay has changed for every store in my area, though. last year, i was making $13 for the few months i spent as a ssv, but i know they were talking about raising pay. i see barista postings on indeed around here from $10-$15 an hour, so who knows. 

but i’m only making $16 now, they’re cutting my hours, and i’m considering moving back to the bux and working my way up this time. as long as i can find a location around me paying at least $15.

so. baristas and ssvs of reddit, how are we liking it nowadays? i know the company is under a lot of fire for the union stuff, but as a day to day job, how are we feeling? pros/cons? advice? etc?

3044,starbucks,"i'm a recent college grad who's been struggling to find a job in my field but need work to get me by - i just submitted my application to a couple sbux locations in my area today and am now just waiting to hear back about whether i'll have an interview.

i'm excited for the job and think it will be a good change of pace from the work i'm normally used to, but since i've never worked for sbux before, i'm not sure what i should ask for as a starting wage. for reference, i live in a pretty big city and applied to a few locations both in and just outside the major city area. i don't want to accidentally undersell myself (i need a way to pay for my necessities) but i also understand that a sbux barista isn't exactly a very lucrative job. previous and current baristas, what's your opinion on this?

i'd also more than happily take any general advice, tips, or insight outside of this, since i'm sure it would be beneficial to both myself and others! although this job will be relatively temporary for me, i still want to give it my all and try to get the best experience i can out of it :)",advice for a new barista

\- coffee

\- expresso

\- iced expresso

\- coffee alternates

\- teas/refreshers

\- blended

i know the frapps are under blended, and the pike and ice coffee are under coffee, but i can't ever remember what the rest of the drinks are, as well as how to mark the cup correctly.

i don't know what drinks are made with other milks, since our starbucks is open the longest, we get really busy. i'm going to work a morning shift and i'm scared. i already messed up a few orders because of the abbreviations.

i’ve been a partner for about 10 months now and i can say that i genuinely enjoy working at starbucks. the teams i’ve worked with have made it worthwhile but i feel like i keep constantly getting caught in the cross fire of something and a customer being shitty to me because of it. i don’t really know how to defend myself because things happen so fast. i’m really sick orders being backed up and customers are rude to me because peak at my current store is a lot and even though us partners handle it well it will still take time because there’s only so much we can do. i’ve dealt with rude customers before and i just brushed it off but this morning i kind of lost it mentally . food was so packed and a customers order took a while to hand off while i was doing dto and i didn’t really get anxious because we were all just doing the best we could. the next guy that drives up comes and he throws a bunch of change at me and he starts screaming “give me the coffee im late to work jesus fucking christ ” and i was quickly trying to count the change and he was like “the fucking coffee please!” and it was so loud that i know everyone inside heard and i was so embarrassed and no one asked if i was okay and i just had to suck in the tears because there was no time to cry as i just wanted to keep the dt times as low as i could while soloing. i’m just tired of how customers project so much when things are not my fault . honestly you’re not going to get your drink in 2 minutes at 9:00am on a weekday. it was ironic because before i took his order there was already a line ??? it honestly destroys how much i enjoy this job and i find it really annoying. i’ve gotten belittled because we ran out of ice coffee and matcha, got yelled at bc i put a  sleeve on someone’s drink (with hot water) or at the fact that i charged someone for chocolate cold foam on a drink that wasn’t a chocolate cold brew. tbh i’m just very mad rn bc i feel embarrassed and humiliated and i try not to take things personal but i’m able to admit this got to me. customers make me feel so dumb. this post is kind of a safe area if anyone feels the same way. i don’t care if anyone thinks this is corny because i am human. thank you for reading. any tips on emotional resilience midst this would be appreciated as well :)

3079,starbucks,"so today i was given a written warning for time and attendance which had verifiably false information on it. it said they received the call at 4:40 for my shift starting at 5:30 which by ""starbucks standards"" is not acceptable because it is within an hour which is not proper advance notice. only problem is i have proof on my phone of the call logs where i had called the store at 4:28am and talked to the shift letting them know i was having diarrhea and could not come in. mind you, i woke up only at 4:20am and as soon as i could upon feeling that i was sick and having these issues. issues that are against food and safety procedures and a major health code violation.   


so, i showed my phone logs to my sm, who then told me that it is ""still within that hour"" and upheld the written warning. apparently, he thinks i'm stupid enough to believe 62 minutes is less than 60 minutes of notice, or that somehow the policy changed and even though everyone has been told ""1 hour"" over and over and over again, it's now no longer 1 hour?  


and now i am at home, about to call up the business ethics and compliance number to clear my name and get this written off my name because it not only affects my job security, but an upcoming planned transfer across the country. unless i am blind, the attendance and punctuality policy does not state any specific time period for the ""advanced notice"" so is this just some fluid number that managers can make up on the spot to screw you over? because, like i've said, i've always been told 1 hour. by my former manager, by this manager, and i've had a written warning before (which was justified maybe) as i had called off only 30 minutes before my shift in an emergency and he reiterated that it had to be 1 hour of advanced notice.   


so i did exactly that. i woke up, felt sick, had diarrhea, called off 1 hour and 2 minutes ahead of my scheduled shift, and now i am being written up. what the hell can i do? i already wrote an email to the business and ethics email on my way home, and plan to call them shortly. am i in the right here or are they going to find some way to fuck me over?",attendance and punctuality policy

3143,starbucks,"i’m a relatively new barista, only 3 months or so. but i’ve been working my butt off! scrambling to take shifts at other stores, grabbing overtime hours like oliver begging for porridge and really putting the green siren first in my life. trying to build the seed of a career. i like my job, i like working at a coffee shop, i just need more money to grow beyond bare subsistence. 

unlike most partners, i actually really enjoy engaging with customers and have gotten pretty good reviews. in fact my store’s engagement number has grown from the teens to the forties in the months since i’ve been hired. it would be assumptive and egotistical to say it’s my fault, but i feel fair in saying i’ve made a meaningful contribution to the stores growth already. so much so my store qualified for a new managers assistant. 

no i didn’t expect to get promoted. the way it was explained  to me, i’m basically waiting in line before an arbitrary time, like a year or something before they allow me to really advance beyond maybe a trainer. 

but instead of promoting one of the many qualified and capable veterans locally she hired some random new guy she said has “previous management experience” i meet him, and talk for like 2 minutes. apparently what she meant to say is by “previous management experience” is that he’s fresh from the army (not an officer mind you) just a regular army guy, young guy, my age. i guess “previous management experience” sounds better than “troopers skip the line peasant.” like, if the guy had some retail experience managing a mcdonald’s or something, i could reconcile that. but i was showing this guy how the register worked and it was clear he was super green to retail as an industry. 

i feel so…..hurt. deflated. again i did not expect to get the promotion. but expected my new superior to be…more qualified than me? like i’m sure the army has given him skills. but i doubt they are starbies retail skills. he’s this newbie just trying to soak in everything. just like me a couple months ago. and like, what about my fellow more experienced partners? it just makes me feel like our hard work is worthless. just cogs waiting for someone from a higher social caste to be privileged the boons of our hard work!

seriously am i being a huge jerk? i just don’t want to have to keep holding the hand of a barista that doesn’t even care about the job.  i know it’s just a job and not that serious but i get chewed out by my sm when a barista isn’t doing their job properly.",trenta rant of a very burnt out ssv

3148,starbucks,"for context, i was hired in late july. i've worked a few weeks now, coming up on a month. i'm only scheduled around 20 hrs/week. i'm still learning and not comfortable yet with everything. most of the longtime employees have been really nice and understanding, except one. i don't know maybe we got off on the wrong foot or i'm reading him wrong. i'll just give some examples. one day, i was on cold bar making fraps. it came peak time when everyone started ordering fraps. i ran out of base and frap chips. i needed them for the next fraps so i'm running around frantically trying to restock while there's a line of cups forming with frap labels. he comes over, sees the line of cups, says ""you need to be sequenc- nevermind, just go on your 10"" and takes over. i just said ""i'm sorry"", changed out the empty bases for him and then went on break. i watched him from the end of the bar slam through the fraps i failed to make. he forcefully slammed the blender cover with each frap. it felt really passive agressive. after that day, everytime i've worked with him as shift lead he puts me on dt. i feel like i'm being punished for that one bad day. anyway, this last time i was on dt he was watching me all shift. all day he just kept chiming in with unhelpful advice. i'm not comfortable yet taking orders while away from the pos but he keeps telling me to start taking orders while i'm putting pastries in the oven or doing something else.

so, at the end of the day, what do you all do with the strawberry acai that remains in the curtis, if there’s any? do you leave the remainder in the curtis since it’s a fresh batch and the curtis was only used for that batch, or pour the remainder in pitchers/cubes and clean out curtis and leave it empty for morning to refill?  

additionally, would you leave the second curtis (that’s already been cleaned earlier in the day) on the counter filled with your strawberry acai backup, or also leave that one empty on the counter with all the backups in the fridge ready to go and poured in, in the morning?","for everyone who keeps their strawberry acai in a curtis, what do you do with it at the end of the night?"

anyways, i contacted pcc as he made me ineligible to be rehired again, and i wrote an appeal document and was denied.

3228,starbucks,"i want to start off by saying, today is the last day for sign-ups, so hurry up and get it done! 

with that out of the way, for those that suffer from mental health ailments, i want to say, our benefits do not help us or those who suffer. none of their medical plans offer any options with mental health, none. so, if you have or can gain state medical, do it! you’ll have a better chance of receiving help rather than paying x amount to find out that you do not qualify. lyra is only good for those that have minor issues and can use simple one on one therapy sessions, but some of us need more than just that, like dbt services, medication, etc.   


so in other words, we sign up for what? spend our money on what? the company earned 8.1 billion last year and these are the services offered to us? they barely give a pay raise to any of the states, hire someone to union bust, and this is also what we receive, the bare minimum! what a great company that operates behind fallacy, a false notion of “happy partners create happy customers”.  

if you cannot pay us a livable wage you might as well give us better benefits, if not, then we are below min. wage slaves.   


if this is how they treat us, the people who made their billions, then i do not mind taking matter into my own hands and teaching people how to make better coffee, espresso pulls, cold brew, etc. from their own home at a fraction of the cost. their beans aren’t the greatest, they continually tell the customers that they are “hand picked”, “best quality ever”, and “you cannot compare their economical resourcing and safe practices”. if you must know, they are hand picked, but by whom? people they pay even less than us. their quality is subpar to grocery store beans that aren’t properly stored, some blends are way too oily and others are way too dry, some you can tell have been expired before their date, you can obviously tell they aren’t properly handled! their economical safe practices are unethical, the people who farm the beans do not live happily, actually the vast majority of them still live in poverty!   


you can create better quality drinks at home from local roasters or online sources that roast their beans with more heart than these soulless bloodsuckers! you can steam milk using a modified moka pot, or you can buy a stove top steamer, and use a moka pot for your espresso beans, you can create your own syrups at a fraction of the cost! cold brews are super easy to make and you can make them even stronger than what the company offers!! hot coffee and iced coffee is far cheaper to brew at home than to shop at the company. starbucks quality is a scam, with heavily processed sugar syrups, you pay for the cups and not the coffee, the cups, lids, straws, utensils cost more than the beans!!! 

just because the company is advertised and is popular, doesn’t mean they are ethically safe, economically great, and overall the best option. it might be time for folks to learn how to do things on their own again and not rely of convenience; convenience, cups, utensils, bags, etc. is the only thing you are truly paying for! btw, the more you support major coffee companies like this, you are furthering the extinction of the beans itself.   


have a good day folks, i’m trying, but working for this company and watching them abuse us isn’t the best time at all.",today is the last day for benefits enrollment. good luck if you have mental health problems.

3262,starbucks,"well, i guess since my last post did well i’ll keep on posting so i keep getting the hang of this reddit thing. 

we recently had to ban a customer. here’s why:
i was on cafe bar making the orders and i’m about to start one and the guy goes “hey hey hey hold on. i’m gonna walk you through how to make my drink”
proceeds to bark orders at me. he wanted me to make the iced latte with no ice and then slowly take that and pour it over a cup of ice and squeeze the cup as i did it. any time i would go too quickly he would yell at me and say go slower. all so he can have a extra half scoop of ice on top. i’m the shift but with situations where it’s me making the drink and getting yelled at i freeze up. so i told myself next time i would not let it happen again. 
apparently he’s a regular i never have to deal with and everyone is scared of him. 

the next time he did the same thing, said “i’m gonna help you make it” 
i ignored him. he told me to fill the milk to the second line and i said “you mean the standard procedure?” and he didn’t really know how to respond. after that i ignored him. i made it the way you’re supposed to and he went “wait wait wait” i said “what was that?” and handed him his drink and a cup of ice on the side. he didn’t really know what to do at that point so he left. 

i told my store manager about this guy because it had been getting out of hand. 

i wasn’t here for the thing that got him banned thannk god. but he came in and did it to a barista and was leaning over yelling while playing with a knife very close to her. basically threatening her to make the drink correctly. and then she didn’t make it exactly how he wanted and another barista tried to remake it and the customer proceeded to scream and cuss everyone out, pointing the knife at them, and leave. came back in and threw the drink and then called several times screaming and cussing. banneddddd bebeee.

3266,starbucks,"this might be kinda lengthy so sorry in advance. 

july 5th or so i sprained my ankle pretty bad and have been on work restrictions of only working 4 hours maximum per shift per doctors orders. my sm keeps scheduling me for over the 4 hours that i am allowed to work and expecting me to find the coverage for the remainder of my shift, which to me is not right or fair because he knows i’m only supposed to work 4 hours. 

about two weeks ago he wrote me up due to attendance, which i thought was reasonable (to an extent because i did use some sick time for said call offs) because i did have a problem like 2-3 months ago with attendance due to some mental health issues. 

fast forward to this week i’m on the schedule for 5.75 hours for monday and tuesday yet again. he sends me home on monday at the 4 hour mark without a problem. tuesday he’s working from home, but my shift sends me home at the 4 hour mark as well. wednesday he comes in and says “what happened yesterday? why did you leave early?” i kept my cool and calmly stated “because i can only work 4 hours per doctors orders, but you’ve known this for over a month now” his response was “this schedule was already made before you went on restrictions, you need to start getting the rest of the shifts covered that you are scheduled over your allotted time” he makes the schedule maybe 2-3 weeks in advance if that, so it definitely wasn’t made before i went on restrictions. he then said that he has spoken to our regional manager and they have both agreed that we need to “get this figured out” (i have an mri scheduled for today so it’s not like i’m just not trying to figure out what is really going on with my ankle) but he hasn’t given me any help or direction on how he wants me to figure it out. 

so fast forward again to yesterday, i go in and he’s doing the normal “how are you feeling? do you feel sick?” i told him that i think i ate something the night before that didn’t agree with my stomach because it hurt pretty bad, and also told him that my ankle was in a tremendous amount of pain, so i might not be 100% my usual self or as fast as usual but i’m there and i’m pushing through. he exploded on me and literally said, and i quote “ you can’t go home early, you’re out of sick time. i’ve been using your sick time when you clock out early and there’s no coverage.” i didn’t even imply that i was trying to go home early for one. for two, i never gave him permission to use my protected sick time for me “leaving early”.  i was under the impression that sick time was only to be used if you wrote it in the book that you wanted to use it or if the sm asked you and you said yes. is that not correct?

2. the quality of coffee beans is consistently poor. they /could/ get fantastic tasting beans, and better brewing standards but instead we get over roasted shlock, but of course it cuts into their profits.
3. lousy pay - 50 cents above minimum wage is super gaming the system, hella not cool. especially in larger cities, and richer areas.
4. i worked my 6 months, looks good on my resume, and i got a way better job at a local ma and pa.

so today i was in the middle of training some baristas for the store that is about to open near us and in walks my manager and he asks to talk to me for a minute. i walk to the front where they were sitting and he basically starts explaining to me that i have to sign a corrective action paper because i called out for 5 days a month ago. the reason i called out is because my little brother (16) had been rushed to the hospital due to his crohn’s disease. this hospital being over an hour away and my mom not being able to miss work because she’s a manager made it so i was the only one able to stay with him. so i called my asm (we had yet to meet the new sm) and explain my situation. she tells me that it’s okay considering i was only scheduled to be training and to keep her updated. well the following monday i go back to work and i have a doctors note from the hospital explaining why i was out. i logged my sick time and it was signed and approved no problem. (as we are allowed to use sick time towards helping immediate family) so i guess i’m just confused on why i was given a corrective action form for a issue that happened over a month ago for something my manager knew about and that i wasn’t able to control? 

another thing, i’ve been with the company for almost a year this month on the 30th and the new store i mentioned is in need of a shift supervisor. i applied and when i was given this corrective action form my manager informed me that it won’t damage my possibly for the position but i can’t help but be concerned especially since with my brother’s disease everything is unexpected. should i be worried?",had to sign a corrective action form today.

for the past probably 8+ years i've been ordering a chai latte and over the years come to a specific order.
-venti chai tea latte
-7 chai
-no water
-2 scoops vanilla bean powder steamed with the milk

i've had many baristas tell me they just steam it with the milk even when i don't ask but we moved to a new house and therefore a new store so i've made sure to order it that way. for the last 5 months they've made it and all of a sudden a new to me person tells me they can't steam the powder it clogs the machine but they can dump it in the chai before adding milk.

so my question is does the vanilla bean powder actually clog the machine? am i making way more work for baristas ordering this way? 

i'm frustrated that this one person after over 8 years of ordering keeps saying something no one else in this (or any) store has ever said.  i didn't just come up with ordering this way, baristas told me they steamed the milk or offered to before i ever tried to order it that way.",a question for baristas

my situation is… unique i guess you can say.

i am a business administration major at my university (not asu). i took accounting and liked it enough that i wanted to major in it. unfortunately, my university would only allow it if i took additional courses. my financial aid does cover tuition… and unfortunately i’m almost at my max year (6 years is the limit i suppose). i would have to pay out of pocket eventually and i can’t afford that. 

when i heard asu offered accounting, i didn’t quit starbucks to receive the benefit. i applied for accounting as my first choice. they made me pick a second choice just in case and did business administration. 

unfortunately, i only got in business administration and not accounting. i was sad lol. 

i checked the requirements (i have a high gpa for my university, so i was confused on what’s going on and i had over 60 credits which they require you have 30 or more college credits). turns out i need a pretty high gpa for high school as well. or have a high sat score… even be 8% of the graduate class? that was wild to me… but long story short i didn’t turn in a high school transcript and maybe that’s why i was rejected? i accidentally mistook corporate accounting (does not need high school transcripts) with normal accounting (which does need hs transcripts). 

luckily for me, high school gpa must be 3.4 to be considered. i graduated with low honors with a 3.5 gpa… maybe 3.6 can’t remember it well. i believe my school gpa system was the same as arizona… but i’m not 100% sure. 

i’m scared i’ll turn in the transcript and still be rejected or if it’s too late. 

is there something else i could do? i heard about pathway to admission helping partners boost their gpa to get admitted. maybe that could help me? or is it only for certain situations? 

has anyone else been in this situation ? 

any advice is appreciated!

thank you!",scap question regarding being accepted into majors with more requirements for asu…

when you approach the barista that’s on the register, saying “can i get an ice coffee?” is not telling me what you want! and than we have to say “black? anything inside?” and what do ya say? “oh no can i get that with vanilla and cream?” … if you know your ice coffee order, please say everything one time!!! “can i get an ice coffee with vanilla and cream?” not so hard is it??

75% of my coworkers i open/morning with dislike me for whatever reason, that’s not the worst of it. to top it all off the main culprit of making my life a walking hell when i’m there is my shift leader, let’s call her r. i have been working for starbucks for a year and a half, i’m a 298 partner and moved to my current store about two months ago. the first few shifts i worked with r was totally fine. i like to talk to my coworkers and get to know everybody and make conversation. she seemed like a nice person. then one day i got food poisoning and had to leave early (i found coverage). she didn’t seem to care at all and while i was in the back resting drinking water almost passed out in pain she kept asking me to come back on the floor and getting annoyed when i told her i physically couldn’t. 

after that, it’s just got worse. any little mistake or anything i do she makes comments on, and she’s even in front of me talked shit to another coworker assuming i didn’t know spanish. now most people in the morning crew hate me. i don’t care, but they’re so snarky about it. they all of a sudden treat me like a new partner even though i’ve been there almost two years. saying shit like “oh would you feel comfortable going on bar later to get in some practice?”. i used to get moved around all positions but for the past few months every shift, and i mean every shift i’ve been put on dtr. not even dto. 

i know it’s not a me problem because every shift at least two customers come to me complaining about how rude r is. and she is! blatantly rude to everyone, especially customers. i’m thinking about quitting even though i like the place, just because morning crew makes it unbearable.",i hate most of my coworkers

would love suggestions from you experts! the parameters are below:

- i want a coffee drink
- i typically order flavored lattes because i like sweetened coffee drinks with some milk in them. it doesn’t need to be a latte, but trying to give some context on my tastes
- favorite flavors are chocolate, caramel, and vanilla (combos of any of these or variations are welcome) 
- no pumpkin (food allergy) 
- can be iced/cold or hot
- toppings are welcome if they enhance the drink

3347,starbucks,"so the store down the road from us is closed for renovations for 2 months so we got some of their borrowed partners. i came in to fill a shift today and saw 2 people that i had never seen before so i assumed they were borrowed partners (they were). right as i get on the shift one of them is automatically complaining about hating being here and wanting to go home. like?? what. and then she starts to get snippy and have an attitude with us.

at first i thought it was just me but she was being insanely bitchy to our shift lead (whom we all love she's amazing) for no reason. listen, we all know it's against standard to have towels on the counters, but our store does it anyway because it's easier to pick up the mess. we keep them roughly hidden away in corners and also underneath our bars so that we can clean up every once in a while instead of having to run around to find a clean towel. 

she gets all up in our faces and basically snaps at us that it's not standard. and i'm like.. this isn't your damn store. i don't say anything but she's really pissing me off at this point. anyways, so later i was on cold bar and put a towel on our cold bar frap roast pump because idk ab y'all but that shit literally leaks and sprays everywhere. about 10 seconds later i see the same girl had taken the towel off.. like wtf do you think it was there for.

not only did she keep moving shit and complaining about how she hated it here. she was just being snippy and snarky about literally everything and interrupting me while i was helping customers and shit. she even opened a new till on the second register just cuz she ""scanner wasn't working"" without even consulting the shift. like wtf. you can't just do that.

the second girl got all pissy when i told her that we hand out cafe drinks in a specific spot and mobiles in another since we are cafe only.. like dude half the customers couldn't find their drinks bc you put them where they don't go. 

overall i did not have fun with how these girls were acting and parading around like it was their store. i've literally been a borrowed partner for their store and another store i'm transferring to and never act like that. 

to top it all of this girl has been working since february, the same time i started working. where in the hell do you think you have authority over any of us??

i’ve been going to my local since september 2021 since my wife and i started a business together. coffee is essential to our day. we started going to our local dt. we visited nearly every day, and now this year it’s once every other day.

the shift manager, she is an absolute delight! even when there is cars behind us, she always chats to us, goes the extra mile and always makes our day. we always leave saying ‘absolutely love her!’ 

when things have gone wrong with orders, even when we order on uber eats for delivery and it’s wrong. we go and see her, she fixes everything. 

when it’s been busy and we’ve placed a mobile order on the app and go through the drive thru, she comes out, asks what our order was and makes it in advance so it’s quicker for us. 9/10, she’ll upgrade our drinks to large no charge. she’ll give us snacks sometimes too even though we’re always wanting to pay for it!

i just thought of posting my experience here, as i’ve sent an email saying how much she is a credit to the store with no reply, so i wanted to inform other partners on here, that you do makes customers days. you will have the horrid customers, but a smile and chat if you’ve got the time, really does make our day!

i will also note, that the other employees at this store, really do half-ass drinks, and she has to fix them, she is a legend!

3369,starbucks,"when i was first hired, we had a meeting for my manager on my first day at my store and everyone just talked badly about them. later to find out that they didn’t know how to schedule properly, had favorites, and would change my schedule frequently in the week without telling me. i’m going to school soon so i wanted to transfer to another starbucks. i called the closest one to my apartment on campus and we went back and forth for about 2 1/2 weeks only for the manager to completely ghost me. so then i tried another store who was ecstatic and said they were definitely needing people and would love for me to transfer, 3 weeks go by and i keep calling back to get an update only for them to say to me 2 days before my last day at my current starbucks that the manager went on vacation and no one knew when they would be back. i understand that managers have lives and are busy but my god they would reassure me that i would get a call back and the manager would be in the store when i called but didn’t want to or didn’t have time to speak when i would call them so an employee would just deliver the same “they’ll give you a call in a day or two” lmao never got a call from either starbucks.",why do starbucks managers suck?
3370,starbucks,"like the title says i was a shift and i just quit without putting in two weeks. i’ll be giving my manager my key tomorrow. i was burnt out over our store having callouts, covid, transfers, bad schedules, negative partners, and new green beans that were unsupported. 

i felt sad for around 20 minutes then i felt a sense of happiness and relief. i liked this job a lot when things were good at our store. the benefits are something i’ll miss but shifts at our store have been terrible for around a month and a half. a lot of our shift team feels demoralized and the urge to transfer or quit.

i don’t even have a job lined up just several interviews. i hope anyone reading this thinking about quitting also does what’s best for their mental health. funny enough i went to go get starbucks at the place closest to my house which i didn’t work at and they were closed early because of understaffing.

3371,starbucks,"dear customers,

when you order ahead via starbucks app, it literally prompts you to ask your barista for your mobile order giving your name when you get to the store. today i had an issue with a customer arguing for the first time working over a year as a barista, i didn’t appreciate it. when you guys walk in the store, we greet you. when you approach us to the handoff plane, we acknowledge you, we give you your mobile order when it’s read when you say something like “hi, i’m here picking up for [insert name].” then we’ll give you your order right away if it’s ready, if your order it’s not ready, we’ll let you know we’re still working on it then we’ll call out your order when it’s ready. but never expect us to call out your drinks when you mobile order. sometimes it might be very busy with lots of drinks to make where we wouldn’t notice anyone coming in, you just sit at the lobby thinking we would call out your drink like we call out in-store orders, then you complain you been waiting for 30 minutes for your order when you was supposed to let us know you’re here for your mobile order. generally, we call out in-store orders, and we put mobile orders to a space where we store mobile orders until customers come pick up their mobile order. it’s funny how customers that order in store, stare at me making their drinks while customers that mobile order just come and sit at the lobby thinking we would call out their order. fortunately it doesn’t happen too often.",we don’t always call out mobile orders
3372,starbucks,"i’ve been working at starbucks for a little while and i feel like there’s so many drinks with little odd exceptions such as the caramel macchiato or the number of classic pumps in a strawberry crème frap.

3374,starbucks,i’m getting tired of my usual iced blonde vanilla lattes or my toffee nut oatmilk lattes and i wanted some suggestions for iced coffees/lattes/cold brews. i don’t really have a taste when it comes to this as long as it’s not with coconut milk and not too bitter.,new drinks
3375,starbucks,"had the best experience ordering my birthday reward. barista i ordered from was genuinely friendly wishing me a happy birthday and helped me with suggestions patiently. i chose the mocha cookie crumble. she suggested using the blonde coffee with as many espresso shots as i wanted (i went wt 2 shots). i asked if i could order that trenta but apparently that size is only for drinks like refreshers so i got it in venti. 

when my order was ready the barista with a huge smile called out the drink and \*for the birthday person\*. i got to my seat and saw written on my cover ""happy birthday!"" :d

i appreciate the friendly service more than the birthday reward tbh 

thank you baristas!

3398,starbucks,"sorry if this is the wrong sub.

i (mtf 20) decided not to work at starbuck's after six days of training. i kind of regret it because i think it could've gone easier with time, but i also was feeling really overwhelmed. 

on half of the days of my training, i didn't have a lot of guidance because we were understaffed. i was working the register on my own on day four. i have a lot of anxiety which makes it hard to remember and concentrate under pressure and my coworkers / shift supervisor were critical when i couldn't remember the order of tasks while in each position. they said that they didn't expect me to remember everything but after a day or two it felt like they did.

however, i think a big part of my experience might've just been me interpreting things in a negative way. i have low self-esteem and now i'm thinking i should've just stayed and toughed it out, and that it would've gotten easier. but i don't think that after telling the store manager that i couldn't handle the job based on six days of training (four hours each) she will be thrilled to take me back after just two days of reflection. i also would feel a little embarrassed even if they did take me back, considering that we didn't even get to me learning how to make drinks.

it also was difficult because everyone there ignored my pronoun pin (meaning they gendered me incorrectly), but i didn't specifically introduce myself with pronouns so i guess that's not really anyone's fault?

should i just move on and try to get a job somewhere else, and then just come back after a year or two and advocate for myself citing personal growth and job experience? i think that this job might be very important to me in the future as a source of health benefits.

what happened was we had one last chocolate cake pop left but i forgot that this other mom asked for it. so when the karen came up to my till and asked for it, i told her that we had one left and she was all happy for it. then i realized the cake pop was for the other mom and i told her. her mood shifted so quick and she just started to get all angry. she ended up calling me a terrible person for not speaking up for myself and this just continued for a couple of minutes. when she asked for the cookies and cream cake pop, i told her that we were all out, which made the situation worse. she proceeds to call my store the worst store and says, “this is so hard on the little ones!” i’m not entirely sure what she meant but i continued to smile and apologize. 

my hands were shaking but regardless of her words, i gave her two unicorn cake pops. i could tell that she saw me do it cus her body language was the tiniest bit looser than when she was calling me these names. after giving her the items, she grabbed her son and walked out. i started to tear up a bit and i didn’t know what to do. so i just helped out the next customer through a couple of tears and a shaky voice. 

my partners are super supportive but i didn’t want them to feel the weight of the situation so i just kept it to myself. it took me a couple of minutes to get over it, but as i began to help other customers, the thought dawned on me. for every 10,000 customers you help, you will always get a handful of karens. and that sucks. but a few horrible interactions can never ruin the amazing experiences of seeing someone’s face when you remember their name and their regular order.",karens

here come bunch of teens ordering what looked like mostly frap. 3 girl teens (i am guessing age 16 or 17) get their drink and sit down near me. i am not really paying attention to them except that i notice how much make up they got on them and then after 3-5 minutes i am hearing sound of splash and a laugh, one of them drop her drink. they all start laughing with one saying, “oh you did it again”. now i am fully paying attention to them, girl gets up and walks over to handout and says in most sarcastic voice, “i am sorry i dropped my drink”. if look could kill, she would already be dead, as barista gave her the angriest look i ever seen before saying “why do you always drop your drink on purpose?” barista points at the wet floor signs nearby and tells her to put it near the spill and that someone else will come soon to clean it up. keep in mind lobby is extremely busy and looks like they are barely able to keep up, drive thru is so busy that cars are backing up on to the street, after 3-5 minutes here comes barista with mop bucket/mop. 

she comes to them and says clean it up yourself i am tired of dealing with your mess or i am going to ban all of you forever. girl that dropped her drink is no longer laughing and instead is now totally red. the other 2 still giggling thinking it’s all a joke. barista goes back behind the counter leaving mop/mop bucket next to the girls. 1 min goes by, and i am thinking they are going to leave and not clean up the mess, finally after few minutes the girl gets up, wrings out the mop and start mopping. took her few minutes to clean up as she did have to rinse out the mop few times. it looked like she did a good job cleaning up. she takes mop back and they give her replacement frap. barista also said, “you drop it again and i am making you mop the lobby completely” in loud enough voice that i think everyone in the lobby was able to hear it. they left soon after that. few others got kicked out for being extremely loud.

3476,starbucks,"i have been working at my current store for about 8 months now, working for the company for a year &amp; a half. at my last store, i met an incredible shift supervisor that eventually got her own store as a manager &amp; has been waiting for me to work for her. she’s awesome and i thrive in her environment/working style. 

at the same time she got her store, i was being transferred for another reason (nothing negative), so i couldn’t go to the store i wanted. my stores management is too micromanaging, all that matters is drive thru times. i once spilled hot coffee on myself, at like 5am,  and no one cared if i was okay, they just took me off drive bar bc times were more important. unless i’m working a closing shift, the environment feels too hostile and high strung.
 anyway, i waited a few months before requesting to go to the store i prefer. my current sm said no because we were understaffed. understandable. a few weeks later we got about 6 new hires. i waited for them to finish training &amp; get used to the store. when i asked again, my sm complained that i was late too many times. clocking into my shifts way too late (when i was about a minute past my shift only twice, &amp; another time i was 27 minutes late because of car problems) she said she couldn’t be like “oh yeah here you can have her at your store with all her problems” i was so shocked i didn’t even respond to that. i’m a good worker, i just want to be at a store where the manager actually likes me and respects me as a human being, not just another body to help get the drive thru times down. 
anyway i’ve been insanely on top of my attendance, picking up shifts and being as helpful as possible so she can transfer me. my family and my boyfriends whole family have been telling me to contact her boss, because there’s no reason she can’t just transfers me especially if i’m unhappy at this store. what do you guys think?",why won’t i get transferred?

3486,starbucks,"so i was looking forward to today as it’s my birthday and i’ve had my starbucks account for like 3+ years, and i was excited to get a free drink because i cannot normally afford starbucks. as a result of not affording it, i never have used my stars, or at least in the last year. i just learned you only get the free drink if you have gotten at least one star in the last year. my friend i’m on a trip with works there and says they’d normally just give out the drink regardless because it’s an unfair rule, would most baristas do that too? i have proof it’s my birthday, like my id and my app says so. i’d understand if there’s nothing that can be done but if there’s like another way to discount it, would baristas be willing to do that? if not, no worries, i’ll live haha",will the barista be willing to give me a birthday drink even without using my rewards?

i just got a bunch of loose leaf tea for my bday &amp; i love the way starbucks makes the shaken teas. 

since we (consumer) can't buy the tazo/starbucks shakers with all the awesome measuring labels how would one go about buying a regular metal or plastic one and making teas/refreshers? there aren't any specific measurements. is there a pdf floating online that has all that? any helparoo is greatly appreciated...

i know it's the schtick to give me a silly name, and i know that it probably wasn't meant to be anything mean, but i can't get it out of my head. i'm fat, i know i am, the last few years have been rough and it's messed up my recovery badly. i really don't want to tell my friend because i am embarrassed to admit that i am bulimic, but it's making me not want to go back to the store. i don't know what to do, do i try to speak to the girl to ask why she put belly? it's not a name!! it just feels really humiliating","the name thing, please help"

why am i being mentioned in the group chat? how were you able to notice i deleted a story? apparently it's something they talked about in the chat, that they were all talking about it.

i want to ask but i know it wouldn't make a difference. the person who told me kind of let it slip, and now i'm replaying and overthinking everything she said and all of her body language.

sorry this isn't that relevant to starbucks. i just needed to get this off my chest.

that said, it's probably just me being insecure. if they were talking mad shit about me, i doubt the girl would have told me. i don't know her well but i know she's always been consistently nice to me and others. i post my art on my instagram so maybe that's the reason",found out 5 coworkers text about my instagram

3525,starbucks,"let's be honest here; starbucks is a mess right now.

from my time working there, and my time recently put, i thought about my experience and the company and wanted to put it here for anyone to read. barista or guest.

here are my observations:

1 - the baristas work so hard for so little pay. just after ordering 3 items, you have already spent what would be an hour made for a barista. imagine the total of orders baristas make in an hour.

2 - the company's response to the unionizing is serious to their reputation and is only adding coal to a fire. if the trend continues, we might see a complete collapse of our brand.

3 - there is a fight between quality of transaction and quantity of transaction. we are mandated to meet ""customer connection"" but under a 30 second time frame to keep up with orders. starbucks needs to pick one or the other and stop stressing our baristas out.

these are just some of my major concerns of the company. it would be nice to hear your thoughts.",the company is a mess
3526,starbucks,"this drives me nuts.
  

i had to tell someone six times today and finally just defaulted to asking if the screen is correct.

3527,starbucks,"so, i’m a new ssv, haven’t even completed half of my modules. i was shown cash management, a few counts, the pastry pull, and how to run breaks. luckily, i was being helped along this summer to be the new ssv so i had done the pulls and helped run breaks. last night was my very first shift as ssv despite not having much training at all. 

i worked really hard and was happy to leave everything looking stocked and great. the baristas seemed happy with it. i took my time on all my shift tasks. the tills were counted, safe was counted, deposit with slip submitted, alarm on, doors locked…

i get a text this morning from the opening shift saying that 2/3 tills were fine and the safe was fine too. but the third cash was short -$80… i said that there was no way. i was very thorough. it is possible that i miscounted but $80 worth? no way.

so i even went in to talk to the ssv who verified that the safe was fine but the till was still short -$80. i’m really upset with this as i was meticulous on my close. i’ve contacted my manager about it and will talk to them tomorrow. i’m hoping that it was somehow put in the deposit bag but to me it seems unlikely! i even went back into the store to check all of the pockets of our dirty aprons!

3528,starbucks,"sometimes the way people order food doesn’t match up with how workers are trained to take orders. a good example of this is when i go to tim hortons and order a bagel belt. belt stands for bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato. i don’t like bacon and i love veggies so i would always order a bagel belt with no meat please. the response was always, “so just egg and cheese?” at which point i would say, “i mean i want the vegetables too” then i would get what i want. but then the next time when asked, “so just egg and cheese?” i would respond yup, and i’d get a bagel with just egg and cheese, no veggies. so then my next visit i’d ask for a bagel belt and no bacon, but please leave the veggies on. this would confuse the worker and i’d have to explain that i want the egg cheese, lettuce tomato but no bacon. this became very frustrating because i knew there was a way to properly order without confusion. i finally found out what that magic combination of words is, egg belt. i say “i’d like an egg belt.” no more confusion.

i have a similar problem at starbucks. i want a cold sugar free drink. i do not want sugar free syrup. i simply want that sugar is not added to my drink. i like the passion tea. if i order passion tea. it comes hot. if i order a cold passion tea it comes with some sugar added and i’m always asked if i’d like to add lemonade. then they always confirm that i want it “with water”. this i frustrating because in my world tea is automatically served with water. so after much discussion i got a passion tea, with water and ice. no sugar, no additives no lemonade. good, i thought i understood. but i just ordered a cold passion tea. i said, please no sugar. after assuring them that i did not want lemonade, i do want water, i paid for my drink and left. but i just took a sip and it’s for sure sweet. so i got tea, ice, water and some sort of syrup but i’m not sure what.

we closed the cafe so hazmat can come and clean it. therefore anyone picking up mobile orders, or anyone who wants to order anything, has to use the drive thru.

i was solo drive thru for a while. i tried my best to get people in and out as quick as i could, but it's still chaos. people drove off because of the line, people needed remakes for one stupid reason or another, people added stuff at the window.

one lady ordered 7 food items, then added one at the window. i looked down towards the ovens, and there was no one there. where the fuck was our food person.

nonstop frappuccinos. nonstop refreshers. nonstop questions. someone walks up to the window and says ""i need to pick up my mobile order but do i have to wait in that whole line???"" i say ""i can get it for you this time but this is a huge safety hazard"". at least she says thank you.

we're all irritable and hate that today is like this. thus, we're snapping at each other. i try to keep calm but i'm actually losing my entire mind.

my hand off plane is cluttered because someone decided to put mobiles there instead of where they usually go, facing the cafe. it makes sense but my hand off plane is approx 1/3 of the top of a fridge. it's very small and can barely hold just drive thru orders. it gets crowded and confusing very quickly.

someone gets put on dto while i move to register. since i only ever solo drive thru, i keep organizing and grabbing drinks from under her even though she's supposed to hand them to me. now what do i do if i don't organize orders and grab straws myself??

there's trays of food all over the back room including on the chair, so i have to sit in the cafe for my 10.

3549,starbucks,"to whom it may concern:

as a longtime patron of starbucks, i just have to say that the rampant corporate greed/“greedflation” i’ve been observing is very off putting. this morning, one of your partners told me that many drink prices have been increasing by $0.50 approximately every 6 months - and this despite a 30%+ increase in profit. do you all really think that all of your loyal customers just fell off the turnip truck and don’t notice? are you not at all concerned with optics?? global supply chain issues and inflation can’t be the reason for regular price increases when profits are soaring. as a result, i have scaled back my visits considerably, strictly because of the principle of the matter. i am aware of much of the good that starbucks does in the world, but price gouging your customers, more and more as time goes on, is not the way. i hope to receive a thoughtful response, not a canned, copied and pasted one, and it would be nice to just feel good again someday about my patronage of starbucks. i still go occasionally, but i’d go much more often if the price gouging didn’t leave such a sour taste in my mouth.",my email to corporate; how do we get through to the top?!
3550,starbucks,"sundays have always sucked for us, and it doesn't help that most sundays we're 3 part for peak. we've had to turn off mobiles because we'd get a drive thru line that wraps around the store and a full lobby so we would literally be unable to make any mobile orders.

today, my store manager said that it was a company policy to always have mobiles on, and he wasn't going to turn them off ever again.

at this point i'm not sure if he's lying because we have to turn mobiles off like 4x/week (not all day-like turn them off from 10-3 while we're short or whatever) or if that's actually a real policy that they've enacted. i'm not sure what will be worse.",my sm just told us we're not allowed to turn off mobiles

3552,starbucks,"hear me out, this is very high-level idea! because, i'm tired of seeing everyone's starbucks' cups in parks and rivers.

3553,starbucks,"just writing things that the company says to you but aren't true.

- that you should not talk about wages with colleagues ️
answer: you should always talk about wages with your colleagues. it's the way to find out who is getting paid less so to help each other get the right pay. 

- you need to find someone to cover your shift. ️
answer: no, that's a management's job. a staff alone does not have the hiring power or tell other colleagues to cover for them while those colleagues are on their day off. 

- denied break time because we are busy. ️
answer: the business will always be busy, so take your break time and care for your well-being first. anyone else saying otherwise doesn't care about you but the sales profit.

this lady, late 20s - early 30s orders a drink in the cafe at the register. and of courseeeeee to no surprise “ it’s wrong” okay coolio. there’s a right way, and a wrong way to handle this situation as a customer. 

but nooooooo this bitch without skipping a beat, walks up to the poor little kid on pos and rips him a new ass about how he made the drink wrong. he is literally not making the drinks he is on register. she’s swearing, waving her hands everywhere, clicking her nails in his face “ every time i come here yall don’t fucking listen i said - blah blah.” 

i didn’t want to intervene because clearly there were competence issues in her department. i’m next in line i politely order my drink, i tipped the kid $20 , apologized on her behalf , and told the kid not to put the tip in the jar , and to pocket that shit!

then another car pulls up and the driver is nice but the second i turn away to take another order the passenger yells at the top of their lungs “excuuse me can i get a spoon” to which my coworker addressed them and let them know i was taking another order.

3570,starbucks,"people who order light ice (especially through the drive through with having to constantly hear them chime in “oh and can i get that with light ice”) are usually just a small pet peeve of mine and tbf i usually do not mind and will regularly give people light ice and fill their drinks above the third line anyways. however. today, combined with how much of a mess our pos was, really made me grow a special immense dislike for people who are insistent on getting light ice.

1. getting light ice is not a “sneaky hack” to get more drink. if your barista is making your drink correctly, there would still be the same amount of drink. if you are still getting your drinks filled to the top, be grateful that you have a nice barista.

just today, i had two people in drive complain about their drink not being light ice. this one girl, who came back through the drive through twenty minutes after her initial order, apparently had “only realized that she had ordered light ice after she finished the drink”. like i cannot even lie. when she told me this at the window, i was literally speechless. she was pointing at this completely empty venti cup with only ice left in it (and not even that much, probably less than the standard amt) telling me that she had wanted it with light ice and wanted us to remake it. she also told me her impossible sandwich was over cooked, rubbery, and she wanted us to remake that as well. 

the second case was about this lady who ordered two paradise drinks. i hand one out to her. she asks me, “is this light ice?” i tell her yes. she looks at me, shakes her head, and says “this isn’t light ice.” i remake it for her except she was rude to me so there’s a little bit of room at the top. i hand it out with the other one (which literally had like an inch of ice. like this was such light ice. didn’t even reach the third line) and she goes “are you serious? you can’t hand people drinks like this. get me your manager.” and this lady was my last customer before i clocked out of a 5 hour shift where i was only on dto. 

be nice to your baristas. outside of standard company practices and doing our job, we aren’t obligated to go above and beyond for you especially if you’re rude to us.

the way my shift lead (who at the time of the two instances had only been on the floor for like an hour or so and i was the partner who had been there the longest so far after the openers had left!!) handled these two events, the pos problems, and me (the only partner that was actually having to deal w the pos issues on solo drive) was unsupportive and plain mean. don’t snap at me and take your frustration of the day out on me when i’ve literally been here longer than you. support your baristas when they’re dealing with a rude customer and don’t make it seem like it’s their fault for inconveniencing and turning the customer interaction that way.",venti vent about light ice

now, i usually wake up at 8 as my routine, so when i called in it was still early (i’m closing shift) and they want me to call in 2hrs later to see if i’m still sick. still sick?? i feel like after everything i’ve done for my location, like cover people or call in early for someone else, they don’t give me the time of day for my needs. it’s ridiculous. they still want me to come in because we are short on people (we have 2 people in training right now so they can’t be left on their own) and i, asides from another co-worker, are the only certified employees who close the store. i’ve already texted with thus co-worker and she’s ok covering me, but they still want me to come in",i’m sick and they still expect me to come in because we are short staffed.

3603,starbucks,"so first off i want to apologize for even ordering this, i've read from this sub that this drink is annoying to make, which is why i went inside for it. i just really wanted to try my favorite hot drink iced. 

anyways i ordered it and was handed a drink that was completely sheet white. it looked like milk. it didn't even have a tea bag in it. i took a sip and tasted very very sweet cotton candy flavored milk. i unsuccessfully tried to stir it up as it all seemed to settle on the bottom. the rest of the drink tasted like straight milk. i guess i couldn't stir it because the whole time drinking it after that first couple sweet sips was just pure milk flavor. no tea. 

i'm just wondering if this was made incorrectly or if this is just how the drink is.",did starbucks make my iced london fog latte incorrectly?

3606,starbucks,"i was wondering if you guys still do latte art since you cover the drink before handing it over (at least where i live). every single hot drink i see being handed over is covered.

3608,starbucks,"people who order through a delivery app are real customers. they have made a purchase and therefore are customers. 
if it's quiet in store and i have a large delivery order, i'll happily bring the in store customers drinks to the front of the queue, but otherwise, the drinks will be added to the queue in the order they are received. 

sometimes if we are particularly busy, at least at my store, it will be one person's job to pack the delivery orders and hand them to the drivers. 
you are a customer. you are not my supervisor. do not tell me ""can you actually deal with real customers rather than waste my time on these silly deliveries."" 
no. making drinks for those who prefer to order through a delivery service is part of my job and they're as valid a customer as you are. if i continue to pull in store customers drinks forward, then the delivery drivers will be kept waiting and will likely be complained at by the recipient of the delivery drinks.

i'm on my break after a busy morning so this probably isn't worded properly but hearing a mother say to her kid 'these are delivery frappuccinos. the staff don't know how to prioritize their customers.' and being told to ""serve real customers first!"" when my supervisor told me to focus on the many deliveries we had - it's just extra stress.

you don't like the extra wait? i'm not keen on extra workload whilst remaining on £9.50 per hour. you get to go out in the sun with your frappuccinos in less than 3 minutes. i have to stand here all day making more drinks. have a little patience. 

sorry, mainly just venting to keep myself sane today.",about deliveries

3615,starbucks,i'll be getting fired in the morning when i go in for my shift. i know this because a coworker told me. and apparently the whole closing shift knows too. that's 5 other people. i stopped by today for a coffee while running errands since it's my day off and a shift told the crew i was fired as of wednesday. i called out wednesday due to throwing up and being nauseas. last time i called out i was given a final written warning with no previous verbal or written warnings/write ups. i'll take the loss or whatever i guess but i'm just really upset that my my coworkers knew before me? like not just shifts but baristas too so im just wondering if there's anything i can do about that? maybe mostly ranting but i really don't want to go in and have my coworkers look and me and know i'm only there to be fired. i feel like only my store manager and maybe the shift leads should be aware of this and not be telling my coworkers.,they know i'm fired...but i don't?
3616,starbucks,does anyone here know if it’s possible to order safe keys? it would make it easier to just be able to open it and not have to wait. i’ve seen that it’s just a magnet of some sort i’m wondering if it just something that can be ordered through amazon or something. any knowledge on safe keys would be appreciated.,safe key

our store is in the process of unionizing but nothing is finalized yet. about half our partners are ready to walk out (since we’re in an area where walkouts have been happening recently) and we’ve had 5 partners quit or who are in the process of quitting in the next 2 weeks. one of those partners has been with the company for years and is so tired of it.

these concerns and she told me we were too busy and understaffed to have it that day and she’ll reschedule it. that hasn’t happened and i don’t feel comfortable trying to ask again as all my attempts have been shut down. our dm is on our backs just as much about every little detail when we’re already super understaffed so i don’t feel comfortable going there either.

fast-foward to 2022, the job market has been pretty tight and i just can't seem to land any interviews. i saw a job posting for starbucks and fortunately i am now scheduled for a phone interview. 


so a little about me... i used to manage an artisanal coffee shop for about 4.5 years. obviously i don't manage anymore, because the owner decided to move on from the business. we had a kitchen... so including the kitchen staff, we had around 12-14 staff members. we served alcohol, brunch, held private events, etc. once a year, staff and i would participate in a local coffee festival, we get to do free pour latte art all day, so that was fun.


some of our ""main"" gears at the store were:
- kees van der western spirit espresso machine
- mazzer super jolly grinder x 3 (2 on rotation, 1 decaf)
- acaia digital scale x 2 (for dry weight)
- acaia luna espresso scale x 2 (for wet weight)
- poursteady pourover machine

in terms of coffee quality assurance:
- tds drip twice a day (done on the first batch)
- tds pourover that's on current rotation twice a day (this was so annoying lol)
- grind adjustment twice a day (dry weight vs wet weight, pull time)
- taste check espresso, drip, pourover to make sure it's within roasters' taste profile

in terms of management duties, the usual stuff... product roadmap (we launched our own coldbrew, gelato &amp; vegan icecream...) scheduling, answering daily emails, dealing with daily unexpected issues, balancing store rent/labor/other profit margins, running to the bank, weekly planning with our baker and kitchen staff, communicating with our accountant, trying to find new roasters that may fit with our customer's tastebuds, staff training, bi-weekly order (beans, fresh ingredients, alcohol, etc, etc).


i am sure i've forgotten some stuff, but yeah... what can i expect from the phone interview? any suggestions or advice? i'd love an input from current store managers or anyone that currently works at starbucks.",store manager phone interview

3673,starbucks,"in both the stores i've worked in i've heard customers complain that we ""prioritize drive thru"" because the line keeps moving while they wait inside. i just wanted to let yall know that drive thru and cafe drinks are made from entirely separate bars, so the success of one does not impede that of the other. the real enemy is mobile orders. since mobile tickets and cafe tickets print from the same machine, it's entirely possible that your single drink is stuck behind a 6 drink mobile order. we make the drinks as they print, and we're just as frustrated about it as you are, i promise. 


also, while we're on the topic of long wait times, please don't leave your kids in the car when you come in to pick up your drink. this may sound obvious but i had 3 different women in 1 week tell me i needed to hurry up and make their drink bc they left their kids in the car in the middle of summer.",drive thru is not the enemy

3705,starbucks,"i left the company last november and took a well-needed mental break. i was a ssv when i left, so when i decided to return to the company, i applied for a ssv position. because of the raise that they gave everyone, it's the most money i'll ever have made.  

anyways, long story short, i applied and got hired at a new store, and now i'm second guessing everything and kind of wish i just applied as barista first. 

i have to go through all of the training again, it feels really odd having someone who worked for the company less than i have ""train"" me, but i understand it's just the way it is.
 
my new store seems very clique-y and everyone has very strong personalities. 

im very reserved and shy and it's started to make me anxious how everyone there seems to behave. 

my friend works at a different store that is closer to where i live and i had originally wanted to apply to, the only reason i hadn't was because they weren't in need of supervisors, however now at this point i'm very stressed with becoming the supervisor of a store and a team i don't know, i'm kind of wondering if there's a chance i can reach out to my friend's store and see if i can stop my ssv training and transfer to that store as just a barista, and then eventually a ssv.

i'm just too worried to talk to anybody about this, i don't want my new sm thinking i'm trying to bail, or not ready to become a ssv, because i'm not really sure what i want to do yet. i was hired on as a ssv and that's currently what i am in the system, so i don't want to make everything difficult. 

the pay is also really good and what brought me back, and so i'm not sure if i want to step down and make barista pay. 

has anyone ever had to supervise a store and a team that they didn't know? were you as stressed and worried as i feel about it? i'm not sure if i'm just psyching myself out and once i'm used to the store and new team it'll be fine, or if i really should talk to my sm about transferring as just a barista to a different store.",i'm returning as a ssv and i'm second guessing everything

to put in perspective, i interviewed for the store that i sent in a request for, as a result, i got accepted at a different store in the same area. 

we talked about first dates and everything and i thought it was handled, and i didn’t have to worry about much else other than driving for the move. my manager tells me that she hasn’t gotten anything from me, and that i need to send in a new transfer for the new store, and that it might take anywhere from a week to six months to transfer….

ive talked with the other manager that accepted me and she said her and her dm would be on top of accepting that transfer form from my district asap. but i’m really worried that i might not transfer in time, especially after i found a place..

3721,starbucks,"* quick background * i'm mormon and stopped attending church about a year ago. at the same time i also discovered vsccb and my deep love for cold foam (mormons dont/arent allowed to drink coffee). i'm guessing this is why i have weird attachment to this drink which represents a little rebellion and freedom to enjoy something for myself. 
all this to say, i've noticed that in the past 2 months when i order vsccb (both at the register and app) it's never what i remember it being. sometimes it is super dark and clearly has very little creamer. others comes with the thinnest layer of cold foam that looks like it deflated in the bottom of the blender for a while.
i've had problems before and remedied them by asking for extra sweet cream or extra cold foam. then a barista suggested i try my tall drink in a grande cup so that they can actually put the extra cream and foam. this worked great for a while too. 
now though, the drink is consistently inconsistent. the other day i had a straight cold brew with cold foam handed to me. no vanilla, no sweet cream. i felt terrible asking if they forgot the cream and the girl at the bar looked back at the other barista to ask and she just said ""i don't think so"". that was the second store i went to that day (truly just because i hate being that person who is super picky and demands a remade drink). 
i live in a college town, so during the school year i don't even think twice, y'all are busy. but it's much quieter over summer and my drink rarely takes more than 5 minutes. are the additions of extra foam or sweet cream or the grande sized cup annoying the baristas (i always worry they annoyingly roll their eyes when my order comes up since my name is uncommon) 

is there a way i can get the drink i want while also being as kind and understanding to the baristas? may the barista gods plz send help",consistently inconsistent vsccb

3724,starbucks,"so i dont really use reddit a lot, but i just kind of need a place to vent about this. i think this is called a venti rant? i'm not super well versed with the lingo. 

i've been working at this store for a few months now, and everything's been going okay so far, but there's this one supervisor who seems to always be looking for things to correct people on. i understand that we have a standard to follow, but sometimes the things she's correcting us on go against what i've been taught or what other people tell me. i still try my best, but all of the corrections tend to stress me out and ironically, i do a worse job when she's leading because i'm so worried about all the little things that she's corrected me on that i mess up basic things on accident. 

today, i was already having kind of a rough day, but for the last hour and a half of my shift, i was put on customer support. 

i'll be the first to tell anyone that customer support isn't my strong suit. most of the time when i'm put on it, it's when we're slammed and i'm running all over the place, so i usually just kind of do whatever's needed of me at the moment, and never learned the customer support cycle. i rely on this piece of paper that's taped up near the task list that lists the cycle.

i was kind of frazzled, but i tried to do the cycle as best as i could. i brewed coffee, and then made sure the lobby was clean (this is what the paper says is a part of the customer support cycle. i don't know if i misread it or if it's outdated or what), but while i was looking at what to do next, i saw a partner had a lot of cards they had to complete, and i wanted to step in and help.

this was my bad, i'll admit it, i should have completed the cycle first. but when i went to go help, the supervisor asked me where i was on the cycle and i froze. i tried to explain what i had done and what i was doing, and she said i was doing it wrong listed off a whole different order for the customer support cycle than what was on the paper. i felt kind of stupid for that.

she lectured me pretty hard. i didn't know how to explain anything, so i just stood there. she has this way of correcting people that makes it sound like she's upset with you for not knowing such a simple thing. i felt embarassed, considering i wasnt doing a good job at cs at all. then she had me do a trash run. 

i started crying during my trash run and couldn't stop. i guess it was the stress of that day, being told i was doing everything wrong, being put in the position im the worst at, all of that just kind of culminated. it didn't help that someone accidentally closed the back door while i was running the trash, and i had to walk through the front door. one partner noticed me crying and offered to cover for me while i went to the bathroom, which was very nice of them but i'm absolutely mortified that i was caught crying at all, especially over something like that.

i don't know what to do. i'm going to be transferring to another store soon (unrelated to this whole mess), so i can only hope that i won't have another shift with her, but if by some stroke of bad luck i do have to work with her again, i don't know if i'll be able to do any sort of job without thinking about how hard i cried. i try not to let things get to me, but this is the first time i've actually cried at work in my almost 2 years of being with this company.",my supervisor made me cry
3725,starbucks,my question being is do you see a lot of ssv burn out in your stores. i worked in a metro area with high volume. but yeah when i became a ssv i came to realize a lot of the shifts in my store / district were not happy with their jobs. also a lot of them weren’t trying to become asm either.,discussion: ssv burn out
3726,starbucks,"my current store closes at 7, which some people seem to have a lot of trouble grasping. literally every night we close at least one customer comes up and tries to pull on the doors, often more than that though. the funniest is that sometimes they will try one door (we have a patio entrance and a front entrance) and when it doesn't open walk around to the other and try it. 
often when someone is doing this i try to signal through the windows we are closed. i'll make an x with my arms, or point at the hours sign next to the door. usually helps them understand lol, plus it feels super weird to just act like i don't see them. 
well tonight a group of like four people (a family it looked like) were trying to get in, and did the two door thing. when i made eye contact with the woman i did my hands crossed thing, and she got it. but one of the guys she was with was still confused, so i did it again, and he looked kinda bummed. so i did a tear gesture, like how a mime might do. the group walked off down the street, and i was chatting with my barista about it and realized that my little tear may have come off as rude.

tldr: i made a mime tear at a customer bc we were closed and he couldn't come in.",i think i accidentally insulted a customer with a hand signal
3727,starbucks,"has anyone else been seeing on social media specifically tiktok, the hate sbux baristas get for complaining about making certain drinks? feels like everyone else is allowed to complain about their job and make posts about it. regardless i’m going to make your drink how you want it no matter how annoying it is.. even if you’re ordering your 5am caramel ribbon crunch, extra caramel, extra crunch lol",baristas aren’t allowed to have feelings
3728,starbucks,"i'm used to being disrespected but i'm getting sick of it. it seems like some customers genuinely get satisfaction from going to starbucks just to suck any joy out of the baristas. 

today a man came through the dt and ordered his drink incorrectly (got an iced mocha instead of an iced white mocha), came in like 15 minutes later and my coworker remade it for him. i'm busy making other drinks for customers, this man yells at me and tells me to grab him a new lid. i look over and can't tell which lid he has, so i ask him what kind of lid he wants. 

he proceeds to say, ""just get me a new lid. can't you see what's wrong with this one?"" (his drink had a tiny bit of vsccf spilling from the nitro sip hole.)

at this point, i'm exhausted, i'm working with a migraine and as always understaffed. i snapped. i grab him a new nitro lid, fix his drink for him, and hand it to him. 

then i say, ""i don't appreciate the way you speak to me."" 

his jaw dropped. he just asks, ""what?""

""i don't appreciate you speaking to me like i'm stupid.""

he's completely dumbfounded, mumbles ""thank you"" and hurries out the door. two other customers have witnessed this interaction and are incredibly nice to me after that. i was shaking for half an hour after this whole situation and am honestly so drained and exhausted, i'm just glad i'm off tomorrow.",finally stood up for myself for once

had another one tell me their pour over was too cold and i apologized and asked if he wanted it remade and he didn’t even respond to me he just turned to the shift like i wasn’t even there?? i didn’t even make it i was just handing it off, but that still shouldn’t matter. no one should be ignored if they’re just trying to fix a problem.

on one occasion i tried to order it without ice, and i was told no? it wasn’t allowed? 

this has never been an issue in the us, so i’m wondering if this is exclusive to australia? 

the second is that today they refused to sell me one because they were out of freeze dried strawberries. 
the other starbucks down the road allowed me to get one and they didn’t have any strawberries. 
couldn’t i technically ask for it without the strawberries anyway?

anyways, i can not tell if this barista likes me. a little back story i came home from uni and went to my local starbucks to be greeted with a “ wow you’re back?? we’re you at school?” this barista noticed i was gone for a year at uni!! i didn’t even know who he was. we talked for a minute, but i let him get back to his job. 
i start coming in … more frequently to the store and we always make small talk ( him initiating ) and it’s cute, casual, fun. 
fast forward a month, im in the drive through with my dog and i see him leaving. he runs over and is like doggggg then is like oh hey it’s you and i’m like haha hi and he’s like what’s his ( my dogs ) name? for sake of my anonymity i won’t give his specific name but i say something along the lines of “ sugar “ and he responds with hahahha you can call me sugar anyday!! at this point i’m flustered bc that was smooth!! he pets my dog and leaves… it’s whatever. his co-worker working the drive through tells me today was his last day at this location and he would be transferring to another in my city. 
naturally, i go to the new location and when i walk in he shouts across the store “ hey its you!!! how are you!!! “ and i’m flustered !! i wave then go up to order and he shouts “ haha i made her blush “ then my whole face goes red. he’s making my drink and asking me what i’m up to i tell him i’ll be out of town for a little and he tells me i need to come see him before i leave to go back to school. 

i’m now back in town. i’ve been back to the starbucks twice and today was the first day i saw him. i walk in and he’s like “ i like the fit it looks really good on you “ at this point im thinking wowwww dude has a massive crush on me, right?!? i’m sitting there working on my laptop and this girl comes in and starts chatting him up and he’s pretty friendly to her … but not in the same way he’s friendly to me.

3799,starbucks,"for context, i’m also a closer myself, but i feel like every single closer at my sbux is lazy. right now it’s just me and this other girl who closes, because everyone else left (most of our workers are university students, myself included). we’re a licensed store so it doesn’t get too busy to the point where we would need more than 2 people after 3 pm. 

the issue i have is that every closer except for me and another guy who left, are lazy. every time we close, i’m the one who has to pick up slack. the other closers always want to close super early, but we aren’t even allowed to close early lmao. the earliest we can leave is 8, since we close at 8. but it doesn’t make sense to mop, shut down espresso machines, etc at 5. now we’re sitting ducks for 3 hours. 

adding onto the fact that apparently before i got here, they always had mandatory meetings because the closers weren’t doing their jobs. i didn’t even wanna be a closer, i got thrown into it because there were too many morning and mid shifters already.

3804,starbucks,"so, here is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down. sometime in the spring of 2022 a mentally unstable woman that happened to transfer to be a manager at my starbucks decided to make everyone’s life hell on earth. she seemed like the type to unload her stress on others. however, she was cocky and very happy looking when it was convenient for her. she is easily one of the worst people i’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting. the only thing i learned from her was to not use heavy amounts of drugs or i would end up looking like her. prior to her managing this starbucks i only had encountered her once and she smelled as though she had just been pulled out of a heavily used sewer pipe. otherwise known as hot garbage. that should have been a warning to me immediately. i should’ve know that her future actions would be the equivalent of her scent that day. i personally believe that the only reason she was promoted to our starbucks was so that they wouldn’t have to smell or look at her anymore. i am 98.9 percent certain that she has a small colony of silverfish bugs in that thing she calls her hair. oh well, she’s probably one of those ladies who doesn’t believe in grooming or taking the time or effort to be clean. hey, to each their own. shortly after arriving at our store she began to change things that had been running smoothly for some time. schedules were changed and she went on with her life being unconcerned for others or their needs. she didn’t care if it didn’t directly affect her. she would act as though she cared and was able to empathize with others, but in reality she couldn’t. she doesn’t have that part of her brain. classic psychopath. everyone at our store began to complain and miss our old manager because he was just an angel compared to her. he was a solid 12/10 and she was a -6/10. needless to say, she made everyone upset enough to seek work elsewhere and actually leave. she believes that all our employees are required to eat, sleep, and breath starbucks, yet she deleted our means of group communication and forbade us from texting her. she needed her time to decompress and the job she chose wasn’t set up that way. we needed means of communication and she disregarded everyone’s opinion and continued her selfishness. what a luxury to have as a new manager at a starbucks. she even gets to bring her child to work! nobody else gets to do that, but she’s a special gal. i guess when your boss is aware that your life is a mess and your situation is just so awful you’re allowed to do anything you please. she looks and acts like a troll. the one with the blue hair except it’s frizzy, faded, extremely damaged, and smells like mold. it’s a trend. imagine a tiny troll looking woman running around acting like she’s working, but in reality she is pretending to work and spends 9 hours decorating her desk area with plastic cubbies and fake succulent plants. how creative of her. her hobbies at work include, but are not limited to: having crying fits, losing her mind over minutest things, stepping out to her car 26 times a day to smoke who knows what, and sitting at a table for hours. it’s a sight to see. so, to end this story, troll woman let me go for being 2.5, i repeat 2.5, minutes tardy. i rushed to that starbucks through some serious traffic that day. i figure that the amount of resentment and jealousy she harbored towards me was just too much for her to handle. it was so evident the moment she let me go. i thought of all the moments she had done wrong and had no repercussions. making schedules inaccurately, changing schedules last minute, stepping to her vehicle 26 times a day, being rude and unprofessional towards employees, giving employees snide remarks, then just an overall lack of understanding and knowledge on her job title. poor woman. i will always be concerned for her. the type of karma that she will receive will be ugly. it really is sad to watch horrible people continue their worst behavior despite being knowledgeable of their shortcomings. if you’re reading this, please send some love out to this special woman because she needs it. she needs all the help she can get. bless her little heart.",how an awful starbucks manager gets away with ruining lives

3806,starbucks,"i had a coworker and a customer lose it on me today because they didn’t know what a espresso macchiato was, and i need to rant. espresso macchiato is shots of espresso “marked” with a dollop of foam. the ratio is half foam and half espresso. if you order an iced espresso macchiato, it is made the exact same way (steamed foam on top of shots) except we pour the espresso over ice. when a customer ordered this today with white mocha, i made what she asked for.","psa: an espresso macchiato is not the same as a caramel macchiato. if you want an iced caramel macchiato with mocha instead of vanilla, ask to substitute the syrup. or get an upside down latte. please do not yell at me when i hand you an iced espresso macchiato w/mocha, when you ordered one!"
3807,starbucks,"i've been a regular at this location for about 6 months now and the shift supervisor is an affable, super professional no-nonsense type guy. he started giving me free drinks a few months back when i'd come in, saying it was on him.

i figured he was just being nice to regulars and i said thanks every time and emailed corporate to praise the staff at the store without mentioning the free drinks.

there was a point when i couldn't come by for a month and a half and when i showed up again he seemed upset. and then he started giving me discounts on my drink. yesterday i went by and he wasn't working, but a barista said to me ""i'm giving you a discount,"" and i asked for a receipt this time because i needed the wifi code that comes with it.

after sitting down i realized the receipt had '30% partner beverage' printed on it, along with the ss's name. that means he's paying what is owed out of his own pocket, right? and he's telling other employees to use his partner beverage on a customer when he's not even on shift?

i feel confused and embarrassed and have no idea how to address it because i feel bad that he's spending his hard-earned money on a customer.

3808,starbucks,"for context, i’ve worked here for over a year and i’ve just transferred cross country; my first day at the new store was uh…something.

for starters, we did our entire peak in a four partner play, which i’ve done before but i was hoping being in a major city might make this less common, though i was mistaken.

naturally we shut off mobiles and uber eats, closed the cafe, all that good stuff. 

then on my ten, i found a bag of crack in the bathroom. just. crack. right there in the bathroom.

later, after mobile orders were off, a lady pulled up in the drive thru, without stopping at the speaker box of course, with a printed out copy of her mobile order. yes, a hard copy of the mobile order with a different address on it.

starbucks needs to hire cleaners.

why are food service people, cleaning mats and bathrooms??? other food service places i used to work at would literally hire someone separately to do this. there are even companies who swap mats on schedules much like cintas with the rags.

i mean seriously. imagine how much easier it would be to just clean things needed for bar and how much healthier a store would be if someone who just cleaned a bathroom is not on bar immediately after. the most cleaning we should even be doing are dishes. 

starbucks has the money to hire cleaners and choose not to. retail stores always hire cleaners to come overnight (ex- when i was an employee at marshall's and dick's sporting goods), so why can't we??

fast forward to now and he tells me how initially he mentioned it being a corrective action, but there isn’t any guidance on the corrective action for my situation. so they submitted it to the starbucks people and have to wait a week to hear back from them. he also said he &amp; the dm agree it should just be a final written warning. i have previously had a final written warning for a customer complaint about “having an attitude” my question is,

so i explained again that they had asked for a decaf frap and didn’t want the creme version so that’s what the drink had to be made as. they blow up saying that they have never been charged that by other stores and i’m wrong for ringing the drink like that and all this other stuff. i tried to apologize that other stores may not have been following policy but there was no other way for me to make this drink. i also told her that the other stores may have just been making her creme versions without clarifying that fact to her.

from some basic research i understand the terraza blend is what the starbucks iced coffee is called, but it's not available for retail sale. so apparently the best recommendation is to use the kenya blend? 

starbucks has a [poorly written recipe on their site](https://www.starbucksathome.com/ca/en-ca/recipes/starbucks-iced-coffee) that doesn't specify amount of ice or change with serving size. they also recommend the breakfast blend roast.

all the intel i'm getting seems to be that the coffee is brewed ""double strength"" and then immediately poured over ice to dilute, essentially making it an american version of the japanese flash brew method... essentially. and then pouring over ice as the non-diluting ice to actually sit in the drink while you drink it.

so if i want to make a single cup (let's say tall size)... what's the best method and roast?

again, i do not like cold brew and i'm not looking for something *better* than starbucks iced coffee... i'd like to achieve the exact same taste at home.

i get paid the same amount no matter what the customer orders, be it ridiculous or simple, yet i find myself increasingly annoyed and bothered by customer orders that attempt to save money or are complicated.

for example, customers who order shots over ice with milk then ask for even more milk at the handout bar - why not just pay for a latte?
we have a regular who does this every day and i understand trying to save money if you get starbucks once in awhile but if you’re going to do it every day shouldn’t you just buy your own espresso machine and make coffee at home?
or even light ice customers - i understand you want more product but the inconvenience of having to measure differently for things like refreshers bothers me more and more these days. 

i understand and admit that most of our drinks are incredibly overpriced ($5 for a tall pink drink is crazy), and i have empathy for customers who may be financially struggling without a lot of money and just trying to get a treat for themselves or their kids, but then i wonder if the money could be put towards anything more worth it? 

my store also has several regulars who request obnoxious things - for example, we have a customer who comes in 2-4 times per day and each time orders 2 drinks along with 4 venti ice cups, 4+ sleeves, 4+ straws, and he asks to sample the beverage he orders even though it’s the same every day - do these people have any slight hint of environmental awareness?

there are a plethora of other things that it can go into other then just wage too. it could go into more labor, more training, a safety net for fallout, more indirect benefits, etc. 

the thing though, is that howie himself has the most sbux shares out of any single person on the planet so stock buybacks help him more then anyone else as all stock buybacks do is artificially increase demand which drives up the share price. 

the saddest thing, is that gross profit is up 16% year over year which means that more stock buybacks are probably coming soon.","fun fact, howard schultz quietly did a 3.5 billion dollar stock buyback in december 2021 after saying that they would do less stock buybacks and ""invest more in our partners"""
3946,starbucks,"so my ex today attempted to run me over in the parking lot at starbucks. he’s been keeping my daughter from me and we agreed to stop by the starbucks parking lot so i can see her for a few minutes. we have no custody order. anyways when i went to go say hi to my 8 month old daughter he thought i was trying to unbuckle her, which i wasn’t. he sped off almost running me over and i had to hold on to his truck door and then i jumped out injuring my ankle. i called the cops. told them what happened and they said that they doubt that the starbucks has cameras outside to the parking lots which i was super surprised about because this was literally in-front of the entrance door . this is a new starbucks that’s literally three years old in a rich neighborhood. it’s a large starbucks too. they didn’t do jack squat and didn’t get back to me today and said they’ll call tomorrow about the security footage. the cops even went inside and i thought they were going to see if they can get footage but they came out with starbucks drinks instead and told me they’ll see what happens. i’m not making this shit up. so is this true?? i thought starbucks would have cameras in the parking lots?",does every starbucks have security cameras outside at the parking lots?
3947,starbucks,"so, ever since i was hired in january, my availability has been wide open with the exception of saturdays. for the first few months, i had no issues and i was never scheduled on a saturday. however, beginning in may i began being scheduled every saturday, every week - and it won't be until *next* saturday that i finally get my agreed upon availability back. 

i had to specifically ask to get my saturdays back, and then my sm said i had to put it in as a time-off request to remind her. honestly, i find the fact that i have to put in *more* effort in order to have my agreed-upon availability respected and followed to be very off-putting, but at least i got my saturdays back - right?

sure, if it weren't for the multiple closing shifts followed by opening shifts i've been scheduled since asking... last friday i closed 4:30pm-9:30pm, then opened 5:30am-11:15am. tonight i closed 5:00pm-9:30, and i open 6:00am-11am tomorrow - followed by a 5pm-10pm close on monday with *another* 6:00am-11:30am open on tuesday. 

fascinatingly, i just looked up the labor code of my state, and surprise! chapter iv, article 15: duration of working time, section 2. "" the duration of rest between working days (shifts) shall not be less than 12 hours. "" 

so, what exactly should i do here? because not only is it disrespectful, it's unlawful to boot.",scheduling is going against state labor code....
3948,starbucks,literally the worst drink i have seen the ice separates and becomes a mess. i literally have to remake it constantly because it clumps together becomes a mess and isn’t properly pourable so it just falls everywhere. the person who orders it also never orders it with light ice but will tell us as soon as we’ve already scooped it that it’s too much ice. and then will go on to say we’re taking too long after asking us to remake it 2-3 times. any tips for making this drink? should we make it like a frappe and only fill to the bottom line? would they complain? feel like there is no winning here. this person is literally never happy with their order.,iced americano blended with no base

3952,starbucks,"so i just saw a video in which a barista (no clue if starbucks affiliated) was talking about drink customization and customers being rude. i check the comments and there is another barista (i also do not know if sb affiliated) stating they give decaf to rude customers. i (admittedly wrongly) stated that we shouldn’t do that cause it can affect people medically. i did state that later on!while i have done research since this (as of now it doesn’t affect anything medical if you use decaf instead of regular) people were leaping down my throat telling me i was wrong and generally getting mad cause i said we shouldn’t be changing drinks up even if a customer is being rude.

my question is: why are we changing up drinks if people are rude? i get it. i’ve had my fair share of ah customers and i have yet to potentially (whether known or unknown medical consequences) harm a customer by changing ingredients. 

if you do this could you explain why you do it? if you don’t want to that’s okay

cause it genuinely does not make sense to me. you will never see that customer again so why are you going out of the way to change an ingredient without knowing medical history or what could affect a customer negatively

this is a genuine post and i do apologize if im coming across as harsh or rude in any way!",a little confused: why is it okay to mess with drinks one way?

i've ordered this drink for a few months now, and every other time (i'm not kidding, literally every other order) the baristas mess it up.

order: ""hi, can i get a grande coffee frappucino? instead of the three pumps of frappucino coffee base, could i only get one pump of it? i'd still like the three pumps of frapp roast, but only one of the syrup coffee base.""

literally had a barista throw a fit today because she swore she put only one pump of it in when the frappucino was clearly made like standard. as a fellow partner it hurt to complain but it was blatantly obvious it was made wrong

for non-baristas, the frappucino coffee base is added at the end so the frappucino blends nicely and is liquidy and sweet. i like mine icy and not so sweet, so i only ask for one. is this order really that hard to understand? currently trying to find a simpler go to drink lol",baristas can never get my drink right

3963,starbucks,"so for context i’ve worked at starbucks for about 5 months. i transferred to a new store in another state about 2 weeks ago. things are very different from my last store. rules are stricter. i use to be able to wear black leggings and now i can’t. hats are also required. i can’t use another persons till for one transaction, i was told i’d get fired today if i did. i know this is the dress code and these are the rules, i’m not complaining i’m just showing examples of how things are different. i knew it wouldn’t be the same but it just feels like a whole different job. it’s been difficult adjusting to all these different rules, people, routines, and things being done so differently. 
sorry for the rant. anyways, here’s the thing. i have no problem following the new way of things, i just need time to learn. but here’s the thing that is really upsetting me. i loved my job before transferring and now i want to quit. i’ve been working at this new location for 2 weeks now. i usually work shorter 5-6 hour shifts and every single shift i’ve been put on dtw, dto, or solo drive thru. i haven’t touched the bar once. i stay on drive thru my entire shift without moving once. at my old store we were usually rotated multiple times a day. certain days i would be stuck on one position the majority of my shift or my entire shift, but we almost always moved around positions. my new store has lots of staffing &amp; my other was very understaffed and we still got rotated. i’ve asked once or twice subtly if i can maybe not be put on drive my entire shift and i still get put on drive. this new girl that transferred a week ago was put on cold bar immediately. i also worked as a borrowed partner at another store in my new state and i was also put on drive my entire shift. and it seems like my other coworkers get switched out for positions. like when someone goes on break. usually at my last store we’d swap to fill in for someone’s break, or if i’d come back from my break i’d fill in for someone else’s break in a new position. at my current store, when i come back for break i’m always put back onto drive. 
i asked my shift today if on tuesday i can possibly not be put on drive my entire shift and she said “we will see who’s here, maybe” and she’s the one that even mentioned how excessively i’m put on drive.
i may not have been working at starbucks for super long like others, but i’m very fast on bar &amp; other areas. it may not seem like a big deal but it is so repetitive, boring, and just genuinely exhausting doing the same thing everyday for my entire shift. greet customers, get payment, hand out drinks, take dt orders, hand out more drinks, repeat 10000 times. i’ve genuinely wanted to cry i get so frustrated. i hate it. i don’t know if it’s because they don’t think i’m capable of keeping up because we are a busy store, or because they don’t trust me in other areas, but i’m so tired and burnt out. if anyone could maybe tell me if this is normal or possibly explain why this is happening i’d be so so grateful.",always stuck on same position. please help
3964,starbucks,"recently i asked my reddit followers if they'd like to buy me a cup of coffee.  that's it, no promises in return, just if they'd like to buy me a coffee.  here's the link: [https://www.reddit.com/user/uberdrivingmom/comments/wgxsd7/would\_you\_buy\_me\_a\_cup\_of\_coffee\_the\_economy/](https://www.reddit.com/user/uberdrivingmom/comments/wgxsd7/would_you_buy_me_a_cup_of_coffee_the_economy/)

a few very good reddit friends and long time followers of my stories and content sent me starbucks cards to my email.  i in turn transferred the amount to my starbucks card.  

last night when i was done driving, i stopped by starbuck, of which i'm a very consistent customer, and lo and behold when i tried to buy my coffee, i was told i had a zero balance?  hmm, that's not right i thought.  sure enough when i checked the balance was zero point zero and the card was closed.

i checked my email to see if starbucks had notified me.  they had not.

i checked my phone to see if they'd called, since my number if on the account.  they had not.

perhaps an im, nope.

i then called starbucks and after being on hold while they investigated and sent me even to another tier 2 person, they gave me an answer.  starbucks security had flagged the card.  of the 12 donations, some number of them were flagged, disputed by the donator.  hmm a family member who didn't agree with the donation perhaps?  i don't know and starbucks wouldn't tell me.  they cancelled the whole card, took my balance to themselves and said i needed to wait 3-5 days while they looked into the issue further?

what really has be frustrated, besides starbucks not calling or notifying me (as all my personal info in in the app) is that two of the donations came through cards that were purchased through amazon.  a wonderful friend, who doesn't have a starbucks card bought the card through amazon and then forwarded it to me.  i added the code to my card to transfer it, and now that's gone too.  so in that case amazon got paid, starbucks got paid by amazon and then proceeded to take my card money for themselves.

i'll update this string as the case progresses but a warning to all those who get a bunch of cards for christmas or birthdays and such.  starbucks will, at their whim, close your account and keep the money that they've already been paid for.  nice scam starbucks!",starbucks cancelled my card and took the balance today.

1. cleaned the ovens with bleach (the toilet cleaner) instead of oven cleaner because she refused to admit that she was wrong
2. had shifts write down the mood and behaviors of baristas and wrote one up for being in a bad mood
3. has blown up on baristas several times being blatantly rude because she’s stressed about something else
4. was adamant that teas are good for 72 hours (even though they’re not) and served expired tea because she didn’t want to admit that she was wrong again
5. has been snippy to partners instead of giving constructive criticism 
6. will be passive aggressive when her ego is hurt (many small instances that i won’t bore you guys with)
7. would constantly promise more hours to partners only to fall short and would get upset when more hours were asked for
8. has a tendency to dislike outspoken partners who are well liked amongst peers
9. watches the cameras at night from her house for hours when she isn’t in the store and will text the shift when she sees something she doesn’t like (this made a lot of people lose trust in her due to her literally watching us over our shoulders)
10. will refuse to let people stay late but will stay anywhere from 2-6 hours after her shift has ended, just sitting in the lobby on her laptop (aggravating a lot of partners)
11. got upset at a partner for offering to switch positions with another partner who had been on bar for 4 hours and was getting tired, making him stay on bar for no reason
12. talks badly about shifts to other baristas blatantly
13. told a barista on cafe/mobile that we were 20 mins behind just to stress her out and then walked away (didn’t get her help or offer to help herself)

to sum it up, my manager is someone who has a big and fragile ego not to mention the fact that she is a blatant hypocrite. she has made a lot of enemies and seems not to care of everyone’s low opinion of her. i have asked a lot of my coworkers about her and nobody has a high opinion of her. this is just what i’ve been told/observed, i’m sure there are more instances that i haven’t been around to see. her snarky and off-putting attitude not only rubs the baristas the wrong way, but even endangers the health of customers (1 &amp; 4). it has created almost a hostile work environment. is there anything that i can do that could be anonymous? i do not want her to hate me more than she does but her managerial style is making everyone absolutely miserable at my store.

later the shift pulls me aside saying i was questioning his authority and undermining him. i said there should be no situation where you yell at a customer and it was inappropriate. he responded with giving the rationale that she shouldn't have been there and how he was only ""a little yelling"". he then asked me to clock out three hours early and go home which i did. i'm frustrated with how he treated the customer and how he treated me. i've spoken to the manager through text and she seems to be taking my side, but i still am annoyed i woke up at 5 in the morning to only work 2.5 hours of my shift then be made to go home. i'm considering contacting ethics and compliance but i'm not sure.",shifts yelling at customer then sending me home early

at the investor day event later this month, starbucks will introduce its web3 effort, which incorporates nfts with a coffee theme. the business announced its plans to enter the web3 market earlier this year, claiming that its nfts would not only act as digital collectibles but would also grant their owners access to exclusive content and other benefits.

 at the time, starbucks provided few details regarding the appearance of its initial set of nfts, the exact functionality they would offer, or even the blockchain it was based on. it implied that there were still unfinished ideas by stating that the plan was probably multichain or chain agnostic. overall, the coffee retailer kept its web3 news fairly high level, explaining simply that it believed digital collectibles could create an accretive business adjust to its stores and that more would be revealed later in 2022.

starbucks appears to be taking a different strategy than some businesses, which hopped on the nft bandwagon without giving their investments much thought in terms of how they would fit with their overall corporate objectives. it sees the collections as a continuation of the devotion of its customers. adam brotman, the creator of the starbucks app and the company's mobile order &amp; pay system, was hired by the organization to assist as a special advisor on the project. in terms of technological advancements, starbucks' mobile order &amp; pay has been one of its greatest triumphs. 

even before apple pay became widely used, the corporation was one of the first to offer the idea of a digital wallet. starbucks mobile ordering has increased along with the growth of mobile payments more generally. mobile orders, delivery, and drive-through purchases made up 72 percent of starbucks' u.s. sales in the most recent quarter (their fiscal q3 period). additionally, as a result of changes in consumer behavior brought on by covid, the mobile ordering sales mix increased to a new high of 47 percent, up 13 percent year-over-year, the business stated.

starbucks posted strong earnings in the quarter, beating wall street’s expectations despite the economic challenges. the company reported revenue of $8.15 billion versus $8.11 expected, and earnings per share of 84 cents adjusted versus 75 cents expected. all in all the blockchain ecosystem has grown exponentially as more people and institutions adopt digital currencies as a means of exchange. the growth  blockchain innovations embodied by the expansion of the nft market as more establishments from various industries flock into the nft space to establish their presence, the success of blockchain games such as splinterlands and the growing popularity of blockchain-based social media platforms like tok lok app, peeteh, and minds.com, which offer users greater privacy and are less susceptible to censorship than web2 platforms like tik tok and facebook. these are all indicators of a growing acceptance of blockchain technology, digital currencies and other forms of digital assets.",starbucks is expanding it's reach into the metaverse. starbucks to unveil its web3-based rewards program next month.

3997,starbucks,"i feel like ssv is such a weird position. we have a lot of responsibility when it comes to ensuring orders are done, pulls are conducted, and shifts are efficiently and correctly, but despite that responsibility, i don’t have any real authority or power. at my last job, one supervisor was in charge of ordering and managing waste, one was in charging of staffing/scheduling/training, one was in charge of cleaning schedules and maintenance, and we all had like our duties and what we were in charge of maintaining. here, it feels like the store manager does everything and i mean, yeah they get paid for that, but i guess it’s leaving me unfulfilled. i just want to know i’m making an actual impact, but i don’t feel i can given how starbucks views the shift position. even things like disciplinary action is frustrating knowing that if someone does something that is bad enough to warrant such action, i’d have to wait for my sm to do it, if he would chose to at all. i guess i’m just wondering if there’s more i can do? like i was in charge of the scheduling block at my last job, so i’d love to take a shot at that, but i know only sm’s have access so is there anything else i could potentially do?",can i do more?

4008,starbucks,"this happened about two weeks ago, caused me to call out the next day, and is partially responsible for someone quitting on their first day

so a woman a bit younger than me comes in while i'm on order support and she brings a been there mug to the counter, as i'm taking her order i'm making small talk and because she's buying the mug i ask where she's from, she's from the north east visiting my state for her birthday, asked her how she liked it and told her i hoped she had fun. as i tell her the total she pulls out her phone and is like let me scan my app, i'm a partner. i scan it and her partner discount applies to all her items, i tell her the new total, she pays and goes to wait at the end of the bar.

i turned back to work on backups again, but i guess as she was waiting she looked at her receipt on her phone and came back up and was like ""did the sale apply to the mug?"" she said sale so i'm like i'm not sure i didn't know there was a sale on the mugs. she asks me to ask my manager, manager isn't in so i ask my shift supervisor, who's doing the pull in the back, if she knew about any sale on the mugs. she says no. i go back up and tell her we're not aware of any sales. she switches up and says ""partner discount"" this time so i'm like oh yeah your discount did apply for $3.89.

she then asks me to go get my manager, so i go get my shift supervisor. who when caught up on the situation, prints out her receipt and shows her that her discount did apply. the woman then flips her lid and raises her voice saying that the discount didn't apply. my shift shows her again on the physical receipt that it did and tells her this was a misunderstanding. so she raises her voice even more to the point my shift even asked her to maybe quiet down, i've been standing next to my shift at the register silent except for when i needed to tell details, but she jabs a finger at me and says ""i want her name (my name tag has my name in old english font) and i want corporates number."" without stuttering my shift goes ""*their* name."" she gets belligerent at this point, telling us we're being rude and this isn't standard and how can we call ourselves a corporate store. all over a misunderstanding that she took part in.

so she tells my shift she wants corporates number, she wants my manager's number, and she wants the dm's number and my shift just gives her the store card because she keeps repeatedly demanding the numbers in a different order. at this point, my shift is just matching her energy and she asks for corporates number again and my shift finally tells her to google it. she can't get any upsetter than she already is but goes ""why don't you know that information"", as a partner that's a ridiculous double standard. my shift finally just voids her entire order and tells her to leave and i go to the back to have water because her reaction to 'a small misunderstanding that wasn't even a real problem' had shaken me as had her yelling. my shift finally passes me in the back as i'm getting ready to go back up and i ask her what's going on and she just tells me we're done dealing with her.

i go back up front, assuming she had done as she was told and left, but she's still in the lobby and as soon as she sees me come out of the back goes ""why didn't you tell me your district manager was out of office till august?"" i didn't know. ""you don't have a note in the back?"" no. she then demands my manager's personal number and says corporate says we're allowed to give that out. (which is a huge no.) i'm like so out of energy at this point from her yelling i just apologize to her. and she goes ""i don't think you are sorry."" for once in my life, i actually was sorry. i don't know what she wanted to hear and i didn't ask. she then goes ""this is exactly how i wanted to spend my birthday"" yeah and this is exactly how i wanted to spend my shift.

she then goes outside and paces in front of the store while on the phone with corporate i guess? and i go to the back again to try and get back on track with what i was doing. apparently, in that time her mom came in and asked us our side of the story. my shift calls our manager to clue her in on what's going on while the woman is still pacing in front of the store and around her car. i was supposed to get off a good ten minutes ago by now so my shift while still on the phone with our manager tells someone who is training (both the partner and bean watched the whole thing go down) to take over order support from me so i can clock out. i then just hid in the back for ten minutes or so before going home.

i called out the next day because it had stressed me out to the point of causing me physical pain but when i came in the day after i was told the bean had quit and that my manager was going to call her manager. i haven't had an update and suspect i might not get one. but since then i've had stress headaches every day and my anxiety has caused me some pretty nasty acid reflux, as well as crying spells here and there but i'm transferring this weekend and am hoping a different environment will help me.",out of state partner lost it on me

every time i get this shaken espresso it tastes different (too sweet, way too milky, etc) where it ends up just tasting like a latte. i loved the smooth espresso taste with just the slight sweet and light milk to cut the bitterness, but i feel like it’s so rare that it comes out how this drink tasted when it was first released. is there a way i can change my order to make sure it’s not just basically a latte? when i’m paying almost $6 for a grande now it’s disappointing when i can even visually tell it won’t be a great one when they hand it to me.

4041,starbucks,"i’m so tired of listening to a barista complain literally every single shift if they’re not on bar. 

when you’re hired/trained it’s explained to you that the job requires you to know how to work in all positions and to do so when asked. 

that means sometimes you’ll work in the drive thru, or on ovens, or cafe register, or customer support.. 

it’s not just all hot bar all the time. if you throw a fit literally every day because you don’t want to work anywhere else on the floor you need to get a different job. i’m so sick of it. 

this is kind of a targeted rant because i work with a barista like this and i have to see her again today and i stg if i hear her loudly complain and argue her way into a different position than where the ssv planned for her to be today i’m going to lose it. no one else in the store complains like that, and she’s not even good at bar, she can’t sequence - always behind, and constantly wandering off in the middle of peak.

however, my sandwich was nothing like the order picture, it barely had any mushroom or cheese. it had almost half the amount of ingredients than the picture, perhaps about 10gr of protein at most.

so first day meeting her i take my first 10, come back and not even 15 minutes later she comes up to me and is like i’m taking over for your lunch and i said “oh, could i take it later?” she goes “no. we have better things to do later than run your breaks” 

pissed off but whatever. everytime i work with her she is just like unnecessarily coaching (like i dropped a strawberry on the counter and didn’t pick it up bc we were busy and i was gonna come back for it later but she coached me on it). she reorganized half the store without telling anyone so we were all like ??? 

today i worked with her and it was just so overwhelming that i had to take like 3 bathroom breaks so i could just cry (i cry when i get overwhelmed let’s not unpack it) and like, she’s a main mid shift and i mostly work mids so i see her often. any advice?

well… it’s because about half of the time, my drink doesnt come with the sweetener.
some experienced baristas would take my order but a newbie would make my drink and forgets to put the sweetener in. 
i would walk back into the store and ask for the syrup again. 

funny thing is, even when i order it via mobile to skip the hassle, the sweetener option says its default 6 pumps of classic sweetener and grayed out. 
if real i’m lucky, i would get my drink sweetened but most of the time without. the order on the sticker wouldnt even indicate to put sweetener in. 

so, when i try to save time by ordering ahead with mobile, i would customize and ask for 5 pumps of syrup instead so that my drink needs “special care” lol 

it happens quite often believe it or not. even last night, i walked in, ordered venti iced coffee with soy with classic sweetener.
when i drank the coffee, it wasn’t sweetened at all. 

i went back and told the barista *politely* that my drink was not sweetened (its routine for me) and she looked frustrated and said “well, how much sweetener do you want?”… well it wasn’t sweetened at all. i told her to give it 5 more pumps of syrup. 

later i found out she was new and she thought one pump of sweetener was enough (for venti?)

4078,starbucks,"hello all, i have a question regarding the change in oat milk. to note, i'm canadian so i am not sure if its different here than from the states/worldwide. 

i'm aware that starbucks has changed their oat milk, iirc it was oatly before? honestly not a fan of the new oat milk, i've now switched to almond but that's beside my point. 

i'm extremely gluten intolerant (in the process of figuring out if celiac) and upon the last time i had gotten my usual  iced coffee with oat milk--which was the point in time where i realized it's different from the previous oat milk--i had a reaction maybe 10 minutes after consuming the drink, and i had chugged almost half of it lol. i broke out into itchy rashes all over my hands and arms. 

now, i eat a vegan and gluten free diet, and have been doing so for over 6 years now. i know i had not consumed any gluten or dairy (very intolerant to both), so my only attribution to those rashes would be the new oat milk.

on the next visit to starbucks i had asked the barista if she could please check the oat milk label for me to see if it said gluten free, and she said she didn't see anything on the box. i would just like to confirm, if anybody knows, if the current new oat milk is for sure not gluten free (and which brand if possible too). thank you in advance :)

sidenote: i think it's very important to notify customers on changes like these. people have allergies and intolerances, so this information should be made known--perhaps maybe it was in other places, but in my store that i've frequented since it was built like 10 years ago, i saw no signs or anything. for example, my mother who *is* celiac had a small sip of said coffee that gave me rashes. thankfully she was fine, but i couldn't imagine if she had gone for her usual matcha latte and ended up very sick for consuming gluten without knowing.

4141,starbucks,"my tale of woe:
i’ve been working at starbucks since ‘07. 
i moved up and became a store manager and have been for five years now. 
last year i had to transfer districts after my cafe store was closed (covid decimated sales). i was placed in a busier cafe but it was manageable. my new dm was an absolute monster. (he is not longer with the company, as is my rm). he closed my new store down “temporarily” which turned into a year. i got flung from store to store. managers quitting left and right. had a hundred partners texting me constantly. finally ended up in the most nightmare scenario cafe store that had not had a leader in the store for a year plus. cherry on top was being shorted on my annual raise (which, still never was put thru payroll before my dm quit)
i had my breaking point after three months. 
this january i took an loa; approved for std. 
i took my entire 26 weeks and had to deal with both unum (which i thought was a ny based ltd company?) and sedgwick. 
i recently just got approval for an accommodation leave (under sedgwick’s std) from 7/7-9/25/22. the paperwork they sent me seems confusing and i’ve logged into the benefits and read through everything i could find; which is a lot of convoluted corporate jargon nonsense. 
to simplify my help need, i’ll just write out a portion of what they sent me:

“starbucks accommodation leave from july 7, 2022 through september 25, 2022. your absences under this leave will be counted against your starbucks accommodation leave entitlement.”

and i have no idea what the hell that even means. i logged into mypartnerinfo to see my ben and loa hours but bc i wasn’t on my store laptop a lot was hidden and i was unable to click on any checks to view. 

i’m hopeful that someone here has had a similar situation and could explain to me what this means. my last mailed check says my ben hours as 20. is that what they paid me or how much i have left. 

maybe these are stupid questions but any advice, help, or info would be greatly appreciated!",help&amp;q’s with loa

4147,starbucks,"mini rant: i work at an extremely busy location one of the reserve locations in fact, (i won’t say which one) but i worked core for two years prior to that as a ssv. i’ve always had a particular distaste for people who lie about their pets so they can bring into starbucks for a cute photo op, simply because the principle is wrong and we can get in trouble for it if something happens.

it’s been sooo much worse where i work now since everyone and their mother wants a picture of their pup in the roastery. don’t get me wrong, i grew up with dogs and loooove them, but i feel it’s completely inappropriate to lie about your pet or esa being a service animal simply because you think you’re entitled to bring them wherever you go. (note: in my state, service animals and esas are not considered the same thing when it comes to bringing them into food service establishments). i’ve done a lot of research about the topic and have even considered looking into a service animal to help with my disability. hence why it’s so heartbreaking to see this level of entitlement everywhere. 

most of all, being in a space crowded with a couple hundred (or more) people on a busy day and then having dogs wandering around and even barking and doing all kinds of clearly non-service-animal behaviour is extremely overwhelming to my neurodivergent brain and for a lot of my coworkers. doesn’t help that of course management only cares about preserving the customer experience and encourages us to not even ask if an animal is a proper service animal...do people not realize they can have their animals seized by the state as a result of their thinking they’re more important than everywhere else? 

note: i understand when it’s hot outside and you don’t want your dog tied up in the heat. where i live is not that hot of a climate, and as a pet owner myself i understand the importance of thinking ahead when you have your pet with you.",i can’t stand entitled people who lie so they can bring their pets into food service places and pretending they’re “service animals”.

4150,starbucks,"at my store, we have a regular who comes in almost every day named michelle (if you are reading this, fuck you, you miserable no life stupid old bitch) who comes in and order a grande or venti mocha frappuccino with soy, no whip, and two shots in a trenta cup. 

if anyone at the register tells her the obvious, that we can't do it in a trenta cup, she ""informs us"" that our sm has given her specific permission and that we need to just right it in as an ask me. this most recent shift that i was stuck on cold bar, i begged/semi-forced my ssv to call the sm to make sure and to ask if we can stop allowing it. she said no and that she did give her specific permission to get her fraps in a trenta and that we just have to do it. history: this store manager is relatively new and our store itself has a history with her and she was banned by our previous manager for harassment. 

after pos, she walks down to the handoff lane at our store and stands directly in front of it with a straw waiting, even if there are people up before her. she will watch the entire time you make her frappuccino. if the shots sit for longer than 30 seconds, she will stop you and make you restart. she counts the number of pumps as you do it. after it's done, she will almost always question the barista. if she suspects you put less pumps of anything required, she will make you remake it. she had one of our newer baristas pull out the coffee base syrup and show it to her and then proceeded to tell her she forgot it. i trained her. she didn't forget it, and she told her kindly it wouldn't have blended to that consistency if she had forgotten the base but she would be happy to remake it if it tasted unusual. she walked out upset after, must've tasted the same so she ate her words.

that brings me to the point of my question. she is harrassing quite a few of our employees, especially newer ones who may be a little slower on the frap routine and when they were just taught not to do trenta fraps. our sm doesn't seem to care and just wants us to bend over and take it. even worse, she frequently misgenders one of our employees and our sm was informed. no action taken. not the first time this employee has been misgendered under this sm and no action was taken even though it was brought up. both customers continue to misgender him whenever they come in while he is working. 

is it worth my time to bring this inaction to the attention of my district managers? should i focus on the selling of fraps in a trenta cup at our store and email corporate? what should i start with to either get her banned again for harassment or to stop getting her way with the frappuccinos...she makes everyone shrink or shake whenever she walks in the door.",recommendation on course of action with problematic customer.

i’ve just hit my 6 year mark (2 years as barista and 4 as ssv) and i’m totally lost, drained, and sick of working in this role. i feel like i can’t move up and can’t quit because of the new pay and the benefits. nowhere around me is paying as much and with benefits as good as sbux (that i know of and have looked into.) i don’t have a degree and i can’t even fathom going the degree route through sbux and trying to hang on for another 3-4 years. i regret not doing it sooner so i would be in a better spot now.

i’ve tried lyra and headspace and i’ve looked into paid loa but i don’t even think that will get granted. i’ve even been desperate enough to apply to any entry level/remote job on the corporate career site for months and all i’m getting is denial. and i already know it’s hard to go from retail to corporate in this company. this job isn’t worth the amount of grief im going through. if i quit and find something else and take the pay cut i can’t afford to live. does anyone have any advice? sorry for this depressing post, i promise i’m not a total cry baby sometimes but please tell me i’m not alone.",i feel like i’m stuck - rant/help?

4192,starbucks,"hi, i'm new at sb, joined for the coverage for trans surgeries. i was aware of the potential changes about to hit but have some questions.

1- where can i find the # for my trans advocate?
2- my understanding is that the changes are: we now need to pay co-payments until our out of pocket maximum is met, correct?
3- regardless of (2), starbucks will/was paying for procedures not covered by insurance. still correct? for example i can get kaiser via sb but a body contouring/bbl isn't typically covered. does this mean that sb would pay for it?
4- considering all of this, i'm assuming if i wanted something done not covered by insurance, i'd have to pay the full amount, and get it reimbursed. yes?

i'll ask the advocate but hoping to get a general sense of what to expect.

i'm already on kaiser, paid for by myself, and met $7.5k / 12k max out of pocket costs already. so the ffs surgeries i have planned are probably better off with my current coverage, along with anything else kaiser covers, until i reach things that they don't, like the bbl/contouring.

here comes this gentleman. i explain the situation after he requests a triple grande iced mocha (i guess i assumed he read the sign and assumed he would order something that i could do?), and he death stares me and says, ""so no espresso?"" before i could assure him that someone was coming to fix it and it'll be back up and running soon. he then accuses me of breaking it myself(?) so i just wouldn't have to sell espresso. i let him know the machine is just old and that it was overworked the past few days to keep up with demands, but it'll be fixed soon. he goes on this rant about how only baristas spew bullshit out of their ass, that im refusing him service, etc.

earlier this month my dog was sick. not in the usual dogs get upset stomachs sick, but not eating, no energy, so much diarrhea and vomiting. when i called in then he said that wasnt an emergency either and i could take my dogs to the vet after work and then pressured me to come in so bad, i caved and and went to mys bift keaving my sick dog at home (which i still hate myself for doing). my dog was sick for a few more days after but my manager still was like ""thats not a real emergency"" and told me i cant call out for things like that. he also ahd a very disapprovinf tone in his voice whenever we talked about it.

well today when he called me to say having nearly all my money stolen and no way to get to work was ""not an emergency"" and that i need to come in later today and pick up a shift tomorrow, he brought up the incident with my dog saying i have to stop calling out for things thay arent emergencies. despite me actually showing up anyway when my dog was at home sick.

on top of all that he said i have to work more than 12 hours or else i am letting everyone else down and it will negatively impact my employment. he kept bringing up how serious thay was and how much he wanted to emphasize it. which i fully agree. except he keeps only scheduling me for 10 hours a week. meaning even if i didnt call out ever i still wouldnt be merting that expectation. 

i am so incredibly upset by that complete and utter lack of empathy, especially in moments where i am already incredibly stressed. i am also incredibly upset thay he is basically putting pressure on me and implying i could lose my job for a matter he is completely in control of...but he acts like thats on me.

i am so incredibly not confrontational and get horrible anxiety so i just dont know what to do here. my heart is telling me to quit but my brain is shouting ""don't"" because i have no backup. i'd tough it out, look elsewhere, and give a 2 weeks notice when i find something, but without a car thats gonna make finding something incredibly difficult if not impossible. and i dont know how to contact hr. the partner contact center really confuses me. plus i do actually like starbucks and most of my fellow partners.

i’m aware that i’m not the only one who has had a cut in hours in my store however this isn’t the first time that she was cut my hours for an unexplainable reason. i managed to scrape by enough hours last week for benefits by picking up hours at another store but it is screwing up my ability to be eligible and remain eligible for benefits.  i have tried being understanding but i have been stressed since i came back from vacation over work hours and i don’t know how to take this any other way except personally.",advice needed

i know starbucks sells most of their own ingredients, which im ecstatic about, but i'm really curious about what machines to put on my wish list. i've never worked in a coffee shop and all i have at home right now is a single serve keurig that goes up to 12 oz. i'd like to make up to 24 oz drinks as close to the original starbucks process as i can get. i'll need to replace my old blender too. and i know i'll probably need an espresso machine, but i'm not sure what to actually look for after that.

also, if i am so specific, why not add an ask me? ""leave room for ice"" or something??? 

i get an iced latte. and i work at starbucks. i know that all i get with no ice/no room is more milk. i don't want to drink more milk to get my caffeine inside of my body, but i also don't want to come here tomorrow to get my morning coffee. 

why we all ignoring this mod? even if i wanted only a little room (which they're not even doing), where my petty ass baristas at? why y'all not trying to prove a point by leaving all the room??? lol because that's actually what i want.

4216,starbucks,"in my time as a barista, (i am approaching a year in a few months) i don’t recall having someone ask for orange juice. however, today apparently it was desperately needed by one of our customers.

i have never seen this customer before, but apparently she had come in two days prior and asked about our orange juice and the people working that day told her it’d be there today. 

she came to order at drive through and asked if we had orange juice. i asked if she meant the evolution drink (we only had the fresh organic defense up one and i don’t remember the last time we had regular orange) and she started raising her voice and told me that she was told it would be in that day. i told her that we do have warehouse shortages and a lot of times we order things but they are not guaranteed to come in because of these shortages. she didn’t take that as an answer and insisted it was supposed to be in today and i kept looking but didn’t find it. i proceeded to have everyone check and look around for it but we still couldn’t find it. she asked for a manager and i told her our general manager wasn’t in at the moment but she could talk to a shift manager.

at this point i realized that she was recording me. she had her phone out the window pointed towards the order screen and was making faces. i was really uncomfortable by this (being a minor) and i told my coworkers that she was recording me and i was getting really upset and flustered. i tend to overthink a lot so i was scared if i was doing something wrong and i could get people in trouble, even though it was just orange juice.

she asked for my general manager’s name and i gave her the first name but i have really bad memory so i didn’t know his last name. she also asked for his phone number so i said i don’t know it but i can look for a business card for her. she proceeded to be silent and continue recording and then pulled out of the line and left.

i’m not sure if she came back, as i said before i have bad memory so i don’t recall faces or last names very well. there were two different people i thought was her and i think she could’ve come back to order something but if she did, she didn’t say anything. for the rest of the day, however, i was really upset about the interaction. i get flustered very easily and stutter and confuse my words, so i was worried if i said something wrong. 

at the end of the day, what this was about was orange juice. we have a gas station right next door that you can get orange juice from, why go to a starbucks for it? why are you trying to have a gotcha moment over it? if it was one of the more popular items i would understand (not really, but it would make more sense) but it’s something you could literally get anywhere, and i’ve tried it once before and it tastes like any other orange juice. 

my message to all customers:
whether it be a starbucks or any other place, please please please show the workers some respect. i have countless stories of customers that have made me uncomfortable, yelled at me, and degraded me. 

i work at starbucks because i love what i do. i’ve met the best people working there and have made so many friends. i should not be dreading my interactions with the customers. there are so many customers that are so sweet, but as always, the bad apples ruin it for me. my store is honestly such a welcoming environment, it feels like a second home to me and it’s basically my safe space, (i don’t have the best home life and i look to my coworkers as family) so to feel so much negativity of the customers taking their anger out on us just kinda sucks. 

idk maybe i’m just overreacting, my job is to make drinks and interact with customers, good and bad. i just think that maybe there could be some room for respect and to not abuse the “customer is always right” phrase. (i am not saying a customer can’t be right of course, but fighting to get your way when it’s literally just an overpriced drink that is out of stock and that you could get a gallon of next door for way cheaper is a little much) i’d understand if people were nice about it, but to treat me like i was scamming you out of your precious orange juice is just a little out of line. 

like no i specifically made sure there weren’t any orange juices because i knew you were coming in. bro i don’t know who you are, please stop treating me like a robot. are you trying to take legal action because we’re out of stock? i don’t know what the goal was and you guys can see i’m getting unnecessarily mad about this, sorry. it just really rubbed me the wrong way.",orange juice?

i’m really upset and angry, truthfully. i’m skilled at my job. i would be a huge asset to train people on bar, which i think is pretty needed with sbux’s shitty training.

i’m going to be “trained” by someone who has less than half my tenure. 

i’m tired of being treated this way. i feel i’m always given the short end of the stick, in terms of recognition. my first sm, trainer and some shifts have vouched for me many times. even my super bitchy ex-sm recognized my tenure and title.

basically i feel like i’m treated like i’m a fool, incompetent. there are other reasons but this is icing on the cake. (especially since my first sm had me leading training sessions anyways.)

i am aware that they prevent you from promoting or transferring for six months after the corrective action, but i had two questions:

a) do they stack if you get more than one? (i.e if you get two on, let’s say the same day, you would have to wait 12 months) or do they simply refresh the six month duration starting from the most recent corrective action?


b) since i can’t transfer or promote for six months, i feel as if it is worth it to work at my local corner store for basically the same pay but 100000x less stressful in the meantime. if i left and did this, would my six month period be up after six months pass, or do i have to continuously work at starbucks for six months or else the “timer” for it will pause until i come back?

now just imagine, you think he’s a nightmare you won’t have to see again because he hadn’t been around for weeks. he shows up at noon and spends his entire afternoon at your starbucks, finally asking for a pour over. the best part? the day was completely dead until 3 pm, and then stayed busy for the rest of the night. at 3 pm (the beginning of your shift) all the trashes are overflowing, the team is out of whip cream and hot coffee, and an oven is off while waiting to get cleaned. he’s visiting for refills often. it hits 6:30 pm. you have 3 newer partners who are all still learning different things and need a little extra support. you have a frozen order to put away, the pull hasn’t been started, you have 2 lunches to run, no closing tasks have been done, and the opener didn’t do the frozen part of the inventory count all while you lose a partner at 8:30. and you close at 9.

if your reading this far and are lost let me give more detail. 

so the cold bar to the siren eye is to be next to each other. but i don’t have enough space to have it next to each other no matter what i do. i did think of something this morning but idk if it would work. i would have to move the brewer and put it next to the pos and move the tea cold bar where the brewer is. but there would be a lot of extra space with the refresher making it longer to reach and dead space. there is a 5 layer syrup stand by the frap station and she keeps wanted to get rid of it saying we don’t need all that syrup. and she wanted to put the refresher fruit pieces by the frappe station. i’m not saying i’m not open to new ideas but i don’t see how that would seem like the correct way to set it up. what should i do?",store level help please

4269,starbucks,"after almost 4 years and 3 stores, i’m finally free from the siren.

a quit for a few months last summer, moved back to my hometown, and got rehired at a store there. that store was an absolute dumpster fire. standards were broken (drinks made wrong, breaks not run, etc), there was blatant favoritism and retaliation from the manager, and multiple partners had called both the dm and ethics and compliance, with nothing resulting from it. i finally had my breaking point after i got written up for forgetting to do a cafe spin  and my dm and another manager transferred me that same day to another store.

that store was much better, but the issues in the company were obviously there too. the labor cuts, call outs, and unrealistic expectations were exhausting. i was so burned out from being the reliable tenured partner. the few times i wasn’t on bar, i’d end up either getting switched with someone or getting stuck catching someone up because i was the one that could do it. i was the one who always came in early or stayed late, and after years of going above and beyond for no recognition, i just stopped caring. i have carpal tunnel in my hand from barring, i’m sleep deprived, and getting yelled at by customers every day was emotionally exhausting.

for context, i work at a grab and go store in a really busy part of the city. since we don't have seating, our washrooms are closed to customers. this has always caused problems between us and customers cuz they can't fathom that we're not just their personal toilet stop. 

i was handing off a mobile today and im not sure if the lid wasn't on properly or what, but as soon as i hand it off the drink spills everywhere. all over the floor, counter, and the customer in front of me. the cafe was full of people.

thank god it was an iced drink - i didn't know what else to do but plead for her forgiveness. she was obviously probably upset but not too mad- that was before she asked for the bathroom and i mentioned that they were closed. she starts arguing with me ... i told her i'm not the one making the rules so she asks for my ssv. 

he ends up letting her use the bathroom anyways which makes sense in hindsight and i ended up feeling bad for telling her no in the beginning... we're very strict with the washroom policy so i didn't think we would allow her i should've asked if we could make an exception.

4281,starbucks,"hi everyone, just had a quick question about starbucks policies and if this specific situation could get me in trouble and if so what the punishment/repercussions could be. (i’m sorry i’m on mobile)

so a while ago a manager was watching my store, and she wasn’t being a very good manager. she wasn’t listening to our baristas or working with us. she would deny vacations and availability changes without reason, and a lot of her actions were stressing out my coworkers.

i heard from another person that she had been acting like this at other stores too, so i decided to be proactive and try to get stories from other partners to bring to ethics and compliance. no one ever responded so i left it at that, never made a complaint, and just waited out the rest of the time i worked with the manager.

4301,starbucks,"today, i went to starbucks to study and ordered a vanilla latte as my original drink. during that same visit, i finished that latte and went to request a refill with a cold brew. however, i was informed by one of the baristas that only “approved drinks” are allowed for refills and lattes are not one of those. 

i let the barista know that i have had done this same transaction of ordering an iced latte as an original drink and getting a refill with a cold brew in the past before at the same starbucks.

perplexed, i showed him the faq below : https://customerservice.starbucks.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6778/~/how-do-refills-work%3f

however, he was insistent that my request is not allowed per the rules. he did end up saying he would give me a one-time exception. i thanked him for the exception and ended up tipping $5 in the tip jar, as i took about 4 minutes of his time and didn’t want to seem like a karen lol as i frequent this starbucks. overall, the conversation was polite with a serious tone. both of us felt certain we were correct with the interpretation of the refill policy haha

i was generously curious about the interpretation of the refill policy, so i re-read it again and i feel like my situation was within this faq policy. the only “loophole” i could see is if they are not a “participating store” or this store has a new store-specific refill policy. maybe refill policies vary by store or the refill policy changed due to “inflation times”?

4304,starbucks,"i dont feel like typing a book about it rn. but pretty much when i came to work, the lobby was closed and a table was placed right in front of the door for picking up mobile orders. plus, cars were wrapped around the entire building. i heard many people called out, so there were 4 of us there for all that chaos. 

i was put on warming, having to do food and take it to drive thru and to the front of the store for mobile pick up. there were also people at the door confused and had questions, and i tried answering them as much as possible because… i can’t turn my backs to them.. it’s not good customer service. i’d be slightly behind on food after trying to take care of them, so i was a little stressed. 

then my sv tells me to do mobile bar while i don’t have food, which was extremely overwhelming because i have to listen for dt orders, check for mobile stickers in two places, and one other thing: i’ve been working at sbux two months today. i’m still not used to all the drinks, only mostly refreshers, frappuccino’s, and shaken espressos. it was sort of hard to ask for help when we were short staffed and everyone had to take care of their own things… 

the last straw for me was when i was back at the door answering people’s questions, and then my sv yelled across the whole store to me to just ask their names for orders and keep it moving. how am i supposed to just ignore the customers? it’s not good for business and i thought it was a thing to listen to the customer. so i turned my backs to them and walked back and i was ready to have a breakdown. she asked if i needed a break and i went to the bathroom and cried, trying to suck it all up and get back out there. then when i came out she told me to clock it early and i felt weird about that since they’d have one less person and idk how that would look with my sm. i asked if she was sure and i’d feel bad leaving them. she said i was in no condition to work and she’d rather me go home… 

it’s currently weighing on me. i texted my sm to let her know and so i can discuss it with her since she’s going to have to be informed.

4315,starbucks,"heyo, a bit time sensitive but still helpful to know for when the backlash hits after this is over.

a shift didn’t show up at their scheduled time. the current shift *has* to be somewhere and can’t stay late (in fact already stayed an hour past in case the incoming shift forgot the schedule changed). manager says she can’t be there for almost two hours, and the shift is not allowed to leave the store, either running without a key holder present, nor can they lock up the store until the next available person arrives to either open back up or properly close and clean.

is there a codified rule? are they allowed to lock up and leave? obviously i think the manager should have told people in advance what to do in this situation, but right now no one is available, and because this shift happens to be at the store they are therefore the one being forced to stay. 

it’s a canadian starbucks if that matters, but any experience at all helps.",can manager make you stay if next key holder doesn’t show up?

4318,starbucks,"i'm a freelancer working on a story about the sbux union movement utah. a partner i interviewed for the piece said, “when covid hit, starbucks raised everyone’s pay by three dollars an hour, calling it ‘catastrophe pay’. if you didn’t want to work, they paid you to stay home. in starbucks’ own words, they doubled what they spent on labor but saw their profit margins decrease by five cents.”

i've found where q4 2020 operating margins decreased by 4.7%, which i think might be what he means by profit margins falling by 5 cents, and operating income took a much larger hit, but i can't find anywhere the cost of labor is specifically broken out and shown to  have doubled. does anyone familiar with the pro union position data points know where i can find that?",cost of labor due to catastrophe pay policies

4321,starbucks,"tldr: i cannot stand working with this one specific ssv. she is absolutely awful at her job.

i have been working at starbucks for 8 months and was promoted to ssv about a month ago, which was the second time i had interviewed. a couple of my shifts encouraged me to interview, but i wasn’t expecting to get it because at the time i had only been working there for 6 months. i thought it wouldn’t hurt to try though, so i gave it a shot. the first time i interviewed, i was not offered the promotion, but it was offered to this other girl, and let’s call her anna. i held no resentment towards anna when she was promoted because she had been working there longer than me (2+ years) and i thought she deserved it. 

i held no resentment until my shifts started telling me how they wish i had gotten it because she sucks at the job and when another shift told me my sm said the only reason i had not gotten it was because anna had more examples of coaching than me, and if i had had more, i would’ve gotten it over her. i still didn’t quite understand why they thought anna was a bad shift.

a month later i was promoted to ssv. all the ssvs that had worked with me during my practice shifts had told me that i was already better at the job than anna. i still didn’t understand why. i did thought get a little annoyed with her because she would just stand around doing nothing when there were clearly things to do and i had to instruct her on what to do when she should’ve been able to take initiative by herself. she’s not a green bean.

i finally understand why now that i’m working as an ssv alone. anna is not good at her job and is a pain to work with. she spends a lot of her time on the shift on her phone. when she is supposed to be doing the 3 hour pull, she is on her phone. she takes 20 minute breaks. she gives incredibly wrong information to the baristas. there was this one time she told all the baristas their 10 starts at the time it says on the ticket on their partner beverage they get on break.  so even if you’re waiting in line for 5 minutes to get a drink, your break doesn’t start until the time it says on the ticket. that is so incredibly not true (at least at my store). your break starts the time you step off the floor and now i have to correct every single barista she told this made up rule about.

her sense of urgency is so frustrating. she has none. we will be super behind on a crazy busy day and she will spend 10 minutes gossiping with the baristas instead of doing her job, which causes me to have to pick up her slack. it is so incredibly hard for me to get used to this position when i am doing two people’s jobs at once. she cannot read the room at all. i will be literally scrambling around trying to get tasks done or the pull done or do a restock and she will just follow me around telling me about her weekend plans or how she’s so excited for this one event coming up. it is so hard to not tell her to shut up, but i have resorted to just ignoring what she’s saying, looking at her, and saying to her “anna, do your job.” 

every shift she hands off to me is incredibly behind, even when there was no reason for it to be behind at all. 

there was one day they were super behind because it had been busy all day (it was double star day, i believe) and i came in at 4:30 . she lets me know all the barista tasks that were done (just foh floors and bathrooms) and rushes out of there. it was super behind and we were down a person as well. we didn’t get to starting syrups until about 6, when we usually start those around 4. the baristas and i somehow manage to get syrups, hot bars, cold bar, sinks, the pull, and milk count done by like 7:15. at 7:15, i decided i was going to count the drawers real quick because we need to get back floors done before we lose a barista at 8. i go to open the safe and the change order is sitting there in door 1 (it’s not even supposed to be in door 1). i was stressed out of my mind at this point because i couldn’t figure out how we were going to get a restock, back floors, and cafe floors done in time when it’ll be me and one barista at 8 and we close at 9. this was also my first time doing the change order by myself, and while granted it’s not that hard, it still stressed me out. that was the first time i’ve cried at work since i was 18. i don’t even cry often, but that was such an awful shift.

the worst part is another shift talked about her concerns about anna with our sm and since anna is going away to school soon, there’s not much she can do. but the thing is, anna will be working at my store during breaks. she’s transferring as a shift to a starbucks near her college and i really hope she gets a rude awakening there. i work with her or get shifts handed off to me from her most of the time and it is so incredibly frustrating having to work twice as a hard in a position you’re still getting used to. it’s literally only like this with her. when i work with all the other shifts, they give me so much support and are always there to help me out if i need it. i just can’t wait until she leaves. one more week.",rant

4352,starbucks,"my cafe only store has a double whammy of being a commuter store plus it’s in a tourist destination. during the week in the mornings, the customers are mainly professionals on their way to work or students on their way to school.  we are busy (usually hover between 45-70 transactions per half hour between 7:00-9:30ish am) but we get through the rushes quickly since the drinks are usually not too complicated and most customers usually order something for themselves. the rushes are also much easier to predict and it’s almost guaranteed to end at around 11 am each day. 

weekends are totally different. most customers come in large groups and families with large orders. or even a single person who comes in will order a whole bunch of food and multiple drinks. most drinks are complicated cold bar drinks with many modifications so it’s hard to get in a rhythm on bar, and then warming gets backed up to where we usually need two partners there. one partner to throw in the food and another to run it so we don’t run too far behind (if we are lucky to have the labor or not have call outs). we will only do maybe 50 transactions in a half hour tops but we will do over $600 in sales for that half hour. then we still remain very consistently busy until i clock out early afternoon. 

for some reason weekends mornings are very hectic and stressful in a way most weekday mornings aren’t. we just constantly feel behind on orders on weekends because of the complexity of the drinks and the massive food orders. it also seems like customers are more rude with us on weekend mornings as well. it’s almost guaranteed we will get some attitude from customers especially in those moments where we feel like we are drowning. it’s just so stressful and i dread weekend morning shifts. thankfully i only work saturdays and not sundays, so i only have to suffer once each week. but still, it’s just really rough.

i’ve worked for the siren for three years now in october and yet i feel like i have nothing to show for it. i excelled pretty quickly and was asked to be a trainer two weeks after i got hired and less than six months later did they ask for me to become an ssv. i loved my job for the longest time, a year into the company i went and opened up a store with my manager who is highly distinguished in the district and became her right hand man. i took it thinking it was going to be an amazing opportunity but it was nothing but heartache and stress on not only my work life but my home life as well. the first six months of that store being opened i was assaulted by a homeless man, robbed by a lady with a screwdriver (amongst other countless irf’s), and never felt appreciated or that i could ever be enough. the only thing holding me up was the green beans that looked up to me and trusted me with their safety because i never let them be put in harms way and did all i could to give them equal learning opportunities. i demoted pretty soon after and  i was promised an equal opportunity to be promoted again when i felt like my mental health was strong enough. i am the only one left at that store from the opening team including the manager and have now gone through 4  store managers in a year and a half. two months ago, i applied and interviewed to become an ssv again because of the raise and i missed being in control of the floor. i have done nothing but advocate for all partners to receive substantial training and help ssv’s with any customer or shift-related issues. during my interview, i asked my manager if there was any hesitations he had on re-promoting me and he said there was literally nothing he could think of besides possible availability issues. nevertheless, i did not get re-promoted and was told that i complained my entire interview about what they were doing wrong. the only thing i brought to his attention was the fact that most supervisors and barista‘s are trained to put cleaning tasks ahead of customers’ needs which results in lower customer satisfaction and higher drive times (with examples from literally that day!) i came in with a plan to resolve the majority of the issues at our store, but all he heard was that he and the other shifts weren’t doing enough. and honestly if i really were to complain during my interview, there’s no way in hell i would still have a job there. so here i am two months later still a barista who is now not even respected no matter how hard i work and no matter how much every single fucking person relies on me at that store(including the 3 brand new ssv’s he hired instead of me). i am the fastest, most efficient, and the most up-to-standard barista you will find in my store. that has been said by all store managers i have had and all baristas i have trained and mentored. but yet i have nothing to show for it and it truly sucks that i am going to have to find a new job and start all over again. i have not been bitter and have continued to support all who ask something of me but i feel like a kicked puppy who just runs back to their owner every time and i am at my wits end.",toddy-sized rant

4359,starbucks,"context. i am very new (2 weeks) working as a barista and i am a trans female.

sorry this is long, but it requires a big explanation.  
***tl:dr: pronoun pins make me feel more dysphoria/anxiety, i'm only wearing it because ""it's company policy,"" however many people in the store haven't been. i'm considering just leaving it off until told otherwise.***  


when i had my onboarding with my manager after getting hired they asked me my pronouns, and i gave them (she/her). afterwards i was handed all my noob items (apron, information packets, etc.), and they go ""...and here's your pronoun pin!""

my immediate response was, ""thanks, is this mandatory?"" at which point they told me that yes, it is the company policy.

first off, i was not about to argue or even question this my first day in the shop. as well, i support our non-binary partners and understand how pronoun pins really help customers gender them correctly, or other trans folks who may not immediately pass as the gender they identify as. i support inclusivity so i have worn it. 

now to explain why i don't like pronoun pins: i am binary, everything i do is to tell the world exactly what my gender is; female. i understand we live in a world with a spectrum of gender, but most people are binary, and i present that way. feminine makeup, long hair, skirts, feminizing surgeries from face to breasts, vocal feminization, etc, i present as femme as i can. but i do not completely pass. i am still working on my voice for example. its like 50/50 i get 'clocked' as mtf.

i don't dislike being trans, but i do not want the world to know i am. that said, for now i have zero problem with someone who misgenders me; i'm either too apathetic in the moment to explain or i can correct them gracefully, no biggie. but my entire goal in my journey is to forget i am trans, pass, and just be seen as a cis female. and with that, pronoun pins scream 'trans.' yes, more and more companies have employees' email signatures with a pronoun preference, and give options for people to wear pins or similar, but i have never been faced with \*having\* to explicitly announce my pronouns on my chest. it gives me anxiety i have not felt in four years, back when i looked like a man in a dress. before working here, i honestly thought it was just trans folks choosing to wear pronoun pins, and also, i dont recall seeing any cis folx or cis passing trans people wearing them ever.

one thing i did request was the same green pin everyone else had. i was given a white pin with big black letters that called more attention to it because our store was out of the she/her ones. green on green, less noticeable. in this moment i also explained all this to my manager; i am willing to do this since it's policy and for the sake of our other trans and/or nonbinary employees. i will say, my manager asked if i didn't want to wear it, and i just said again it's fine, because i'm brand new. i kinda forgot about it and have just been waiting for the green pin to show up.

now you may be thinking i'm being unprogressive, but please understand, the pin makes me think way too inwardly about myself and how i am perceived. finally, i wrote this post because today during my shift, no one was bothering to wear pronoun pins **except** for the nonbinary partner and other new girl. my trainer didn't have it on, my shift manager did not have theirs on, other partners didn't. just the new person and trans folx.  


\-

so, in closing, does everyone wear these pins in your store? do you think i should investigate if my manager will let me pass on it, being so new? i need to wash my apron tonight and i'm tempted to just not put the pin back on and say i lost it. i really don't like it. it's not like people don't wear white shoes (against policy), have shorts 6+"" above the knee (against policy), and wear earring bigger than a quarter or whatever the handbook said.

all things considered, i'm here for the trans health benefits and i will do whatever is necessary to do well at this job and get them. i work seven friggen days a week, i want my peers to like me, and i want to do a good job.  


thanks.","partners, does everyone in your store *have* to wear their pronoun pins? *advice please*"

4384,starbucks,"today while i was on my lunch, with 2 hours left on my shift, i was about to clock back in, and i was blindsided by my manager telling me i was running the floor today during their shift meeting. too shocked to say anything i just followed orders while running a busy floor while trying to get our tasks done. this is the second or third time this has happened the exact same way, where i have been told with no prep time that i would be in charge as a barista, and had to run breaks and place other in their positions, etc.


i’ve expressed interest in a casual discussion about promoting about a year or so ago, but i made it expressly clear to my manager that i have no more interest as i’m in no position at home to do so, as i just got married and we have a new puppy and don’t believe i can commit to that responsibility, and i feel uncomfortable to do so as i feel awkward in a command position. even after expressly meeting with her, she still has me run the floor without warning. 


is this normal? if she knew that all the shifts and her would be unavailable for a meeting, should she have asked a shift supervisor from another store to cover for that time while they were meeting? i’m highly debating leaving a letter (since she doesn’t read her emails) saying how disrespected i feel, since she wants us to come to her with any and all complaints. this seems to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back for me as there have been other numerous experiences i’ve had with this manager/starbucks the company that has lead me to look for work elsewhere.

4407,starbucks,"almost since its inception, starbucks has portrayed itself as a leader in eco-friendly business practices.  i had no reason to dispute that image until i became a frequent dine-in customer.  i first noticed their disingenuous portrayal when i found it a necessity to always keep a warm pull-over in my car just for my visits to starbucks, no matter the season.  i was not alone, as i observed others almost shivering, or making comments on the chilliness.  i would even see baristas wearing sweaters.   this was not a one store phenomenon, it was the case in virtually every starbucks i visited in atlanta.  

ten years later and a relocation, i don't find the same conditions exist (as much), however i went through considerable effort to bring this situation to the attention of starbucks management, in one case complaining by phone, to customer service, about a store blowing the ac while it was 55 degrees outside.   my beef on this point is that i calculated that starbucks, with its 25,000+ stores, was wasting energy, enough annually to power a small country.   and, that if every business entity followed their 'leadership' we'd be that much deeper into the climate change dilemma. 

now, post covid, as though it wasn't bad enough before, i find starbucks' behaving just as eco-unfriendly as ever.  while we all want to prevent the spread of viruses, we don't need to behave irrationally just to give the 'appearance' of doing so.  the biggest virus of all may the irreversible climate changes going on, to that end we should be making every effort to conserve energy consumption; which is done by optimizing the use of products created with energy generated out of climate damaging processes.   in this starbucks is one of the worst offenders. 

despite all my best efforts to have them conserve, not waste, in the course of serving even just me, their baristas are 'forced' to take numerous unneeded actions, to include the trashing of completely unused products, as if we were in a surgical unit.  they insist on putting tops on a cup i'm taking to my table, where then the top gets throw out.  they insist on putting cup sleeves on, even when i say it's unnecessary, which in seconds then go into the trash.  they insist on giving me my creme in a paper cup, again with another top, both of which go immediately into the trash.  no longer, like most places now, do they make use of self-serve canisters, more apparently due to customers who turn their coffees into lattes via the former mode.   

these 'policies' are not mere guidelines, with their 'aim' being their guide.  they are carried out without any thought as to propriety, by mindless robots.  it isn't as if i'm careless in regard to viruses.  for over twenty years i've been vigilant about not touching publicly handled surfaces.  the rhino virus would lay me up with brutally long coughing fits, and i knew i wouldn't be able to handle them as i got older.  my twice annual 'colds' almost disappeared.   thus, when covid came along, i was already use to the antiseptic mode in public.  

but, i use logic in the process of exercising each of my actions.  one of the steps i've taken, for two decades, is to handle any item like a credit/debit card by the edges when handed back to me by a store clerk.  retail clerks (including starbucks' staff) have handled many hundreds of such items from just as many people by the time i make my purchase.   

yet, with all of the purported virus safety actions they do every moment (which needlessly waste the energy used to produce them and add to landfills), when i look at the barista at my local starbucks, who has just swiped my starbucks 'rewards' card and is handing it back to me (virus laden), and i suggest to them that they (starbucks) make their credit card device capable of handling the 'rewards' card, they look puzzled.   or offer irrational excuses, like ""oh, that would take a new piece of equipment.""  to which, i would remark, ""yes, and other non-franchise starbucks have such equipment.""  some how, that evokes the response, ""they can do it, because they are a different company.""  ugh.  the obviously too bothered barista then offers, ""i can give you some anti-bacterial hand wash."" 

merely, suggesting that he/she pass the 'thought' along, gets a shrug, or a refrain about being powerless; this i get even from store managers.  

when placing an unused spoon, still in cellophane wrapper, upon the 'condiment' counter for possibly someone else's need, that same barista passing by immediately took it and threw it in the trash, seeming not to even care that i would catch it in my peripheral vision.  i could only grin.   

i suppose what irks me the most, is that starbucks has long used the social issue of environmentalism as a tool in marketing itself.  it really is no more eco-friendly than koch industries, who at least aren't hypocrites.",starbucks' environmental friendly persona is all hooey

4412,starbucks,"hey all,
i’ve been a partner for a little over a year. got promoted to ssv a few months ago. i transferred stores in order to get promoted.
honestly my manager is fine, and i like my coworkers at this store but i’m over the job. i was at a drive thru and now i’m at a cafe. the staffing just feels so uneven now with the smaller staff. even though it’s less busy, it felt easier to be at a busier store with more people working. also i used to work mid shifts, and now i’m closing all the time and i hate it. i’ve tried really hard to have a positive outlook and give myself time to adjust to the position, but it’s just not working for me. also i really dislike the customers at this new store. i’m used to incidents and karen’s and i can deal with that, but i feel like the average joe customers are just much more rude on a consistent basis. nothing major enough that i need to file an incident report, but enough that the lack of manners and respect has made the job a lot less enjoyable. 

overall, i’m just not happy with the job anymore. and while the pay increase i got from the promotion is nice, it’s still not worth it for me to stay here. i’d rather work somewhere i don’t actively dread on a daily basis.

i was wondering if anyone had tips/advice for quitting, since it’s not a super emergent situation. i know i’m waiting to say anything at least til that raise kicks in on the first, so i can say that was my last pay rate. also, i know that sick time doesn’t get paid out. i was planning on calling out after i put in my 2 weeks notice, but i read that can be considered leaving on bad terms. so i’m guessing i should use up a bunch of my sick time before i put in my 2 weeks notice.

4414,starbucks,"went to a drive thru to pick up a mobile order today. i’m hard of hearing and frequently pull up to the window to give my hand-written orders in drive thrus. my understanding is that this is common practice with hoh and deaf customers and i’ve never had an issue with it. 

today the barista working the window sees me behind another car (i could understand not knowing i was there, but she clearly saw me behind the car that ordered in front of me) and when i get to the window, she takes her sweet time getting to me then whips it open and snaps:

“you didn’t say anything at the box! you’re supposed to say something at the box!”

i calmly tell her that i’m just picking up a mobile order, too shocked to say anything else because of her snapping at me. she huffs off to find my order and comes back, practically throws it out the window st me, then slams the window shut in my face. 

so i’m wondering did i do something wrong here? i thought she just had a bad day or something like that, but she was very friendly with the people in the car ahead of me. was i in the wrong here? is there something i can do differently the next time i’m in this situation to prevent it from going bad again?",was i out of line?

4443,starbucks,"background info: i've worked at my current store for almost 2 years. i am currently a barista trainer with open availability, i've never been reprimanded at all, and i'm never late or call out. there have been 2 instances that i've come to my store manager asking for help with certain situations (ss literally yelling at me while making me stay late after a close, to the point where it broke sb policy for minors, and when a ss who is the current main closer refused to use my correct pronouns/told coworkers that looking at me is ""like staring into a black hole, devoid of all emotion""). sm assured me that everything would be taken care of and apologised for their behaviour. there was over a year between complaints if that's relevant. 

at one point after this, i overheard sm telling current ss that i have a ""track record"" and not to worry about my complaint. this hurt, especially as sm has known me since i was 16 and ss had only been working at starbucks for 2 months at this point. i've overheard many, many, hurtful things said about me by ss and ignored them because of sm's response the first time. 

my store has recently lost 2 shift supervisors, one being a planned move by a closer, and one sudden loss (not death lol) of an opener.
because of this, our store manager (who typically opens) has been closing on specific days. i decided to apply for closing shift supervisor to help fill in the gaps, and had my interview with a store manager from a different store. 

everything went well, at least from what i've heard, but my store manager said that she will have to personally see me coaching my peers before she makes a decision. she will be coming in and watching me work for a few shifts, which is all fine and dandy, except for what she said after. 
she told me that she wouldn't be able to let me know if i got the job or not until the first week of september.
 i interviewed the day after i applied, at her request, because she said she'd rather do it sooner than later. i've seen multiple people become shifts from baristas and i've never seen or heard of this happening. i'm just not getting the right feeling from this situation.

i understand that supervisors need to be team players, positive, etc, and aside from the instances mentioned above, i can't think of a time where i've been anything less than that. i can't say for sure what the reasoning is behind this, but i do think it might be somewhat connected to the ss that has consistently been hostile towards me. is this common practice that she's just decided to enforce with me? i am a little too close to this to be able to see it objectively, and i'm aware i might just be overreacting, but i have bills to pay and i can't keep working 15 hours a week at 12 dollars an hour.

4461,starbucks,"i’ll start by saying i absolutely adore my sm and have no reason to believe she’s trying to screw me over or hurt me in any way. i believe she is trying her best to understand and act within starbucks guidance.

that said, my issue:

i am apparently the unluckiest motherfucker around, and despite being vaccinated and boosted, i tested positive for covid on june 6, at which time i used my self-isolation pay without any issues. 

now, 52 days later, i tested positive again, and am (mildly) symptomatic.

i have found coverage for all the shifts i was scheduled for during what should be my self-isolation timeline.

however my sm is saying that if a partner has another positive covid test within 90 days of an initial positive, self-isolation is not required, and therefore i cannot receive self-isolation pay (though i’m free to use sick hours.)

now, i believe that to be true for the sake of people who continue to test positive long after an infection, but what i’m experiencing now seems to be a new infection, and i am symptomatic, however mildly.

further, [this](https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/response-to-covid/) message says that partners may use two rounds of self-isolation pay per quarter. a quarter is 90 days. it does not stand to reason that i would not be required to isolate this time around.

i don’t want to call partner resources on her, but she said this morning when i brought that message to her attention that she would make some calls and get back to me by the end of the day. she hasn’t, and i would like whatever clarification and/or advice you folks have to offer.

4465,starbucks,"hi, tomorrow will be my third day working at starbucks. 
i have a pretty busy store and i’ve honestly had to pick up things pretty quickly. i just wanted to share my experience and ask for any advice before i go in for my third day tomorrow.

1. so on my second day i did training in the morning with a trainer over customer/store support and then was scheduled for a coverage shift in the evening on what i’ve learned. i was honestly very overwhelmed since this was my second day and i didn’t understand the whole coverage/training shifts. at first i didn’t really understand what i was suppose to do, i was constantly asking the other baristas if they needed anything and felt kind of like a burden, at one point i just refilled ice, refilled cups,and hid in the back trying to figure out what to do. i had to work 12:00- 3:30pm that day by myself and i was already dreading this part of training as i felt under-prepared. i ended up asking once of the veteran baristas if she needed anything anything and she started giving me a few tasks that would help the store, i ended up making lemonade, refilling the açaí refresher, one of the baristas asked me if i knew how to refill the tea packets which i responded no to and she showed me where the tea was was and where they went, i even refilled the coffee kegs that contain the cold brew with the help of an experienced barista. the supervisor even ended up showing me how to know how much milk goes into each fridge and giving me reminders on the recipes of whipping cream, vanilla cream and how much goes into each. i honestly still feel like i was still unprepared to work a coverage shift alone but i’m glad it ended up working out and i had a great time.

i wanted to ask a few questions to the experienced and inexperienced baristas on how working their first shift alone went and ask some questions about the customer/support role.

1. can someone explaining the brewing process, i’m still confused about how the brewing process works and why we brew; i’ll be asking my trainer to go over this tomorrow so i just wanna make sure i have everything done since i feel like it wasn’t explained that well?
2.  is it normal to be working a coverage shift my second day, it seemed like a lot people were shocked since they didn’t really know what i would be doing since i didn’t really know how to do anything, it’s so much different learning about skills and then actually doing them on the floor.
3. does everyone date things differently, i learned how to date things differently with my trainer and i felt everyone dates items different. can someone explain the correct way to do it. here’s an example on how i was taught to date things. if the whipped cream expires in 24 hours and todays date is 7/28 i’ll grab a friday sticker and put the date 7/29 and will be discarded at 9pm. can someone give insight on this? 
4.  can you guys share your experience working at starbucks your first week? i didn’t enjoy working without a trainer; i’ve never felt that overwhelmed on my second day. hopefully throughout this week and next i’ll my trainer by my side and i’ll make sure i clarify any concerns i have.

any tips and advice to a novice barista would be helpful, especially if anyone has any links to any quizlets, flash cards or helpful material that will help prepare me for my next week working on hot/cold bar, cash register and ovens. thank you!","starbucks first week of training, questions and concerns?"

i mean-- one recipe i read here suggested for a single serving to use 3 tbsp heavy cream, 2 tbsp 2% milk, and 1tbsp vanilla. this wouldn't be very sweet, but it would also be far above the calories of a single serving for a tall if i put exactly this amount in my coffee lol

i can start by saying that i have two regulars who order their food in very particular ways, and we've named it after them amongst ourselves. you can order a bagel (customer name)-style and we'll know what you mean. 

i also really like making shaken drinks. it's just fun and satisfying. i love when someone orders two of the same refresher at the same time, so i make both of them in different shakers, and i shake them both at the same time. i feel like some funny anime character.

i like when someone orders an iced mocha and i pour the espresso over the syrup and mix them as the espresso pours. i think its really satisfying to blend them that way.

i like putting a dome lid on a frappuccino and then adding the whip

i like when someone orders a specific drink that i like

i like when someone asks me what i'd recommend and listens

i like when someone orders a drizzle around the cup. i think it's fun to do.

i like when someone comes in with a dog and i offer them a pup cup and they say yes and then i get to watch the dog get excited and eat it

4493,starbucks,"hi y'all, currently at my store there is a situation where i think i am being bullied and i'm not sure what to do. 

a shift supervisor in my store doesn't like me and at first i thought it was all in my head. i will refer to him as orange for anonymous purposes. 

orange tends to glare at me while we are working a lot. he doesn't really talk to me in a friendly way like he does with others and one time we got into an argument regarding my lunch. ever since this argument,he treats me differently. there are times when it's very busy and he decides to put me on bar by myself despite me asking for help. one time i was scheduled for clean play with orange and orange didn't help me with anything. i did all the cleaning,i closed the store, i did nearly everything by myself and all he did was stay in the back and do the ""count"" and ""pull"" for hours. eventually we got out very late and he told me ""this was not okay,i feel like we need to do better than this"" i was so exhausted mentally and physically and i was genuinely shocked he told me this after i did everything. i broke down crying in the parking lot in my car, i just got so overwhelmed. i gave him the benefit of the doubt and ignored this.

2 weeks ago, i signed up for a double shift but i felt awful while working. i felt very nauseous and my head hurt a lot so once my morning shift was over,i clocked out and i headed home. once i was home, i thought maybe resting for a bit would fix how i was feeling. it didn't so i called in and let orange know i wasn't feeling well and couldn't come in. he said okay and told me to find coverage. i used my sick time for this and wrote it in the punch communications log. a few days after, a barista let me know that orange was saying he didn't believe i was sick and he thinks i was just trying to get extra time without working.

out of curiosity i checked the book and it turns out someone had crossed out what i wrote with black sharpie. i immediately contacted my store manager and she said she didn't do that. i didn't do it and i thought it was probably orange. i told my manager that i was being targeted and that i felt unsafe and paranoid. i specifically told her i feel like this was an attack and she dismissed my feelings. she continuously kept telling me it was just a misunderstanding. she told me she fixed this and i got my sick time but some shift supervisors let me know she said in a meeting they had that i actually did not get my sick time at all. in this same meeting,orange actually confessed to crossing my name out with sharpie. he said he did it because he thought i wrote it there by mistake?? my manager completely ignored my feelings and allowed this to happen. 

where do i go for help to correct this? what do i do? :( i feel like i'm being targeted by orange and that i'm not being heard at all by my manager. i was thinking of transferring maybe. please comment any advice or resources. i printed a few documents to read if any of this is allowed or what rules specifically this breaks.",help

4508,starbucks,"i just transferred to a new store and i am going to lose. my. marbles. out of the 4 stores that i have worked at, i have never seen a warming support work like this. 

i usually pull a few stickers at a time or all of the stickers in a single order and then stick them on the rack to look at. i like this because i know where everything is at, can see everything that i need, and i know if i can put multiple items in the oven at once. while both ovens are occupied, i put the stickers on their respective bags and so on. 

at this store it seems like my warming supports main job is to just get in my way. i’m not allowed to put stickers on the rack, i have to immediately put them on a bag. my warming support does nothing but move the stickers and put them in a cute little corner on the bag. they put pastry stickers on bags and then set them behind me and then run food. 

i’m going absolutely fcking nuts because they all do this. this is the most widely inefficient system i have ever seen. i will admit that the past stores i worked at were never run to standard so nothing was ever done right. but the way i do it works for me and i know that if i was just left alone, i’d be able to go 10x faster than having someone stand in my way and move my stuff around.

4512,starbucks,"why do people think that ordering an iced espresso with light ice and extra milk is going to equal a latte? had a lady mobile order a triple iced espresso with like sixteen pumps of syrup, extra 2% and light ice in a venti cup. got mad when it was only about half full. i told her that she got light ice, only three shots of espresso, and even pointed out the 'ex 2% 3/4''' on the label. it literally tells you how much milk you're getting. i don't know about anybody else, but 3/4"" definitely does not equal the full amount of a venti cup with light ice. 

&amp;#x200b;

she told me she's never had this problem before. i told her that usually we put extra ice in the cup, so it looks full, but it's really just mostly ice, and that light ice means the cup won't be filled. if someone filled the cup for her with light ice before, they were making it wrong. i told her her options were for me to charge her for a latte or for her to take it. did not look happy when i said the drink was gonna be like 6-7 dollars. 

&amp;#x200b;

if you're looking to save money on coffee, go to a local coffee shop or make it at home yourself. please stop berating us for reading the labels, i understand if the label wasn't clear, but it literally tells you the exact amount of milk you'll be getting...

from what my manager has said, we aren't supposed to double-cup, but we make an exception for g/v americanos and teas due to the temperature of the water. (i was told by others there has been incidents of people complaining).

yesterday i was on bar, and i had this mobile order come in for a shaken espresso with a ton of different modifications on it. it was terrifying to look at, but i thought, “what the hell, i like a challenge.” i did it super slowly, and i was triple checking i got all the steps right, and then i finished the drink. it had several layers, and i was pretty freaking proud of it.

a few minutes later, the barista on drive thru went to get the drink i made, and he said over the headset, “op, did you make this mobile order?” my first thought was “ah, shit, i screwed up somehow” because usually when someone asks if i was the one who made a drink they have something to say about it, like it having drizzle when it wasn't supposed to or it looking too dark or i didn't layer it correctly. another barista thought this too, because she was on her way to to grab the sticker off the drink so she could go ahead and remake it herself.

but then, he said ""no, i just wanted to say this looks beautiful."" and it made my freaking day, because a lot of the baristas at my location had been super rude to me for not knowing/remembering certain things and messing up, so a compliment on a super hard drink was something i needed. just wanted to share, because even though i'm still screwing up all the time, and it'll take a while before i fully earn my coworkers' respect, i am improving and stuff like this really inspires me to keep going.",finally getting the hang of it!

for more details: this specific person said they wanted light ice and light milk and complained on tiktok showing us that their venti sized drink was half full expecting more coffee.

first of all: why tf is it always the shaken espresso?

second of all: does nobody know the difference between regular drip coffee and espresso? like what makes you think the barista is gonna fill up your shaken espresso with more espresso because you wanted more “coffee”? if you wanted more coffee then pay for the extra shots. 

third of all: you wanted light ice. the espresso is gonna melt that. and then you wanted light milk .. so ofc it’s not gonna be filled up all the way.

i took the next car &amp; as they literally snatched their drink from my hand *almost dropping the hot coffee* they said “i saw the dog lick your hand, that’s disgusting you need to wash your hands right now. i cant believe how gross you are.” 
so i nicely told him it was my coworker and that she is currently washing her hands before returning to work. he cut me off to say “she needs to be fired you can’t touch dogs. it’s unsanitary.” then just drove off angrily.

now two things really bother me about this:
1. the obvious, being that of course we always wash our hands if we pet a dog or touch trash or any of that. cleanliness standards are important to uphold 
2. if he was paying that much attention he should’ve noticed that the hand/arm petting the dogs was covered in tattoos, while my arms/hands have no tattoos at all.

it’s something about just being so rude about it that boils my blood. he could’ve just been like “hey i saw what looked like you touching a dog, did you happen to wash your hands before grabbing my drink?”

i’ll start - it’s hard to choose a favorite partner since i genuinely enjoy working with all of them. but my supervisor (or assistant manager? idk lol), “electron,” really stands out. electron greets customers loudly while helping out behind the bar and regularly pushes me to be the best i can be, frequently checking in to make sure that we’re on the same page and she’s not pushing too hard. my favorite thing is how she greets and sends customers off - “have a great day on purpose!!” or “happy monday! you woke up today and that’s awesome!!” might sound a little cheesy or overly optimistic to you, but if you experienced electron’s attitude in person, you’d get it. sometimes she can get an entire tense, backed-up cafe to laugh out loud.

my favorite customer is easier to choose, even though there are a bunch of really cool ones. “neutron” comes in everyday, walks up to the register, looks you dead in the eye, and says “tall. pike. black.” he punctuates each word and says nothing else. maybe it sounds rude to you, but i get the sense that eye contact and interacting with strangers is something he had to work at early on in life, and the way he orders always strikes me as cute, and it makes me happy to see him (not just because his order is easy!!). neutron’s is the first face, name, and order i learned by heart.

4555,starbucks,"i was excited to start, liked all my coworkers, the manager, etc. 

but i’m two weeks in and the foreseeable schedule is like 19 hours a week. an outside partner i know said it’s becoming more of an “earn your hours” thing.

i have rent, bills. say even if my hours go up, i’m worried they can get randomly cut and leave me scrambling. i’m worried this isn’t a stable job. on top of that i don’t really feel confident in the training (my trainer was great, but understaffed and things got rushed). 

so out of anxiety, i went and picked up another job. it’s at a bar, anywhere from $20-$25 /hr starting out. locked in schedule every week. 

now i’m wondering if it’s still worth it to stay with starbucks at this point. i really hate the idea of ditching my trainer/manager and everyone i just made friends with.",should i stick with this job?

but at one point, someone came in wearing a shirt that i assume they got in reykjavik (since iceland was spelled as ísland). i’ve been wanting to go there now that i’m starting to save money for vacations and wanted to ask if they got the shirt there and if so where did they go, how did they travel around, etc. this would have been a great customer connection moment because i genuinely wanted to know more and talk to this person but i had to just hand her the drink and say goodbye because this company puts us under such time constraints ",wish i had a moment to connect with a customer today 😢

( i currently am scheduled for 35.75 hours this week and the next as well ). when i got hired, it was said it was completely fine if there would be a change in my schedule as i am still in school, do that reassured me. but... 

i noticed that going into a new month, they did not ask for my availability and they kinda just scheduled me. do you guys have an app where you give your availability? or should i let my manager know that i will have to switch to part time soon? because i am not working full time when school comes around, even if im doing online, i need to balance that and work. sorry if this was all over the place. give feedback please.","question about scheduling from a newly hired, please answer lol"

guys i know that you are understaffed, and that corporate is ass, but as someone who is a former barista turned customer,  starbucks is so expensive and i come because the baristas near me are (usually) really friendly, and it's right next to my job so it's convenient, but i will drive just a little further to the one in target if it means getting my drink made correctly.

i recently learned that people were taking ""agua frescas"" and calling it ""spa water"", and a variant of that is this drink called jamaica... it's our passion tango tea bro. i tried some from work and sweetened it and i actually enjoyed it, but then i felt annoyed that this drink that a different cultural group enjoys doesn't even know what it is because of the name. what latine person is going to walk into the store and see a pitcher of ""passion tango"" and say i want the liquid that looks suspiciously filled with food coloring (cause the color is so stunning it looks unreal) and say i want a passion tango. short answer- they won't.

4672,starbucks,"ok so let me try to explain this. something i always have trouble with, is when people put me on a pedestal when im just being myself. 

from the outside looking in, i understand why people put me there. i am young, i speak articulately, im not ugly, im getting my masters, im mature/not petty or vindictive, im also mild mannered/can be quiet, i don't really have any responsibilities outside of going to work part time and school, i have a very ""she has her life organized"" type of energy, most importantly im a nice person with a positive aura. by no means perfect, i am very lucky/blessed but i also was taught how to work hard and i do.  i understand how i appear to the outside world. 

sometimes when i go to work with people (adults) who have a lot more on their plate and who life hasn't been that kind too, i start to feel guilty when they put me on this pedestal. they see me going about my business and its like because of how i present my self, im either treated like an alien, an angle or like i'm a problem child. honestly if someone has a problem with me i genially don't care and will peacefully avoid them. but when people put me on a pedestal and say things like ""wow your sooo happy"", or ""well you don't really have problems"", or ""i wish i could be upbeat like you"", i get so tongue tied and don't know how to respond to this stuff. i don't enjoy the treatment, mostly because i suspect that when i leave the room there is much negative talk about me. it just makes me feel so weird and awkward because from my perspective im not doing anything spectacular, but yet it's treated as something abnormal. inside i think "" sorry im not as miserable as the majority!"". 

i just want to come in do my job, collect my pay and get out. im not interested in being perfect or making people feel inferior (without even really doing anything). some of my coworkers are very negative people and make fun of my upbeat mannerisms. i don't like when they do this, but i don't want to get on anyones bad side and create an even more negative environment.

many months ago, i was promised a ssv position but never got around to it. i thought the management would promote me soon so i just stayed quiet. but then later on, someone quite new got promoted to be ssv.
i wanted to be gracious and congratulated them.

and as of recently, i've heard that one other quite fairly new staff member was getting promoted as well.

it felt like a slap in the back of the head to see others who are newer than you getting promoted ahead.

i've been always trying to go the extra mile of doing more work and upselling. but at what cost? keep getting passed over?

4686,starbucks,"before i go on about my rant, i would like to say that mental health is real and important, and i mean no offence to anyone with any psychological issues/ health conditions. 

as a newly hired external ssv, i learnt soon after starting working that my store has an extraordinary amount of partners dealing with mental health issues; partners with depression, anxiety, panic attacks ad nervous breakdowns every now and then. 

again, i do not mean to be a dickhead but why do i have to deal with their mood-swings, mental breakdowns, tantrums and anxiety attacks while i’m on the floor making sure that things run well? i’m not a psychologist or a psychotherapist and i certainly do not have a masters degree in dealing with partners that are mental health patients?????

anything and everything i say to them and around them is taken out of proportion, they get offended easily or i end up having to give literal therapy sessions while on the floor, as some partners start having mental breakdowns while working and others start feeling a sense of inadequacy and incompetence. i can’t even compliment other partners for their good work without these partners going, “why don’t people ever say good things about me” and “i am sorry i am doing my best but i just suck”.

all of this has been taking a toll on my own mental health, feeling the need to fix everything and help everyone feel good about themselves while trying to stay sane myself. i can’t help but question why i have to go out of my way to help these partners function well on the floor, while starbucks continues to hire more and more partners dealing with similar mental health issues without providing us supervisors with any specific training to help us work more effectively while working with partners that are dealing with mental health issues. welp",i probably sound like a dickhead venting about this but my mental health also exists and it too is taking a beating.. :(

this happened a while ago but i need to get it off my chest, one time some woman came through the drive thru n had this long ridiculous order w like 2 trenta teas w 14 pumps of syrup minimum in each one, 7 food items and a bag of coffee beans. she got to the window n was super rude, complaining about the wait time n all. she waited until the payment already went through and she was given most of her stuff to ask if she could use her partner numbers to mark out the coffee. threw a fit n made the barista on window ring up the whole order all over again just to mark out the stupid beans. 

when we were done ig it still wasn't over, cuz she decided to turn into our parking lot, open the door, take one of the trenta teas w 37364 syrup pumps she paid for, take off the lid and dump it all on our parking lot

she took off after that n my manager had to go out w a pitcher of hot water to run over the whole mess which was already starting to seep down the slight hill toward the street

a venti iced americano w/ 4 splenda and a splash of whole milk. it literally has water in it and if i’m not mistaken splenda isn’t like sweet sweet yk? it has sort of an aftertaste to it. anywho she has finished the drink so me and the shift are puzzled by what she wants us to do with this now. she doesn’t want a refund or a refill and she can’t get it remade bc it’s just ice bc she completely finished it, she wants to know why her own order isn’t sweet when we put exactly what she ordered in her drink. it took her the whole drink the realize it wasn’t sweet??? as we are telling her this over and over we are getting nowhere. she literally just wanted to create a problem with the drink. ffs.",asking for a remake (?) after finishing the entire drink.

when they pull up to the window they're pissed because we forgot whip on one of their iced coffees. they're pretty rude about it, rolling their eyes and pulling faces at me, but i just bite my tongue and put the whip on it to get them out quicker. i hand out the mocha cookie and the person in the passenger seat is immediately yelling at me that it isn't right, isn't what they ordered, i screwed up again (almost verbatim - ""you messed my drink up""). i say, ""i'll remake it for you, sorry. you said caramel cookie crumble at the speaker, so i took a guess."" as i'm remaking it for them, they take the liberty to scream ""caramel ribbon crunch. caramel ribbon crunch. i want a caramel ribbon crunch. you hear me?"" at me while i remake the drink. i hand them the drink and the person in the passenger seat goes (venemously, of course), ""have a blessed day."" i told them to have the day they deserved and heard them scream in rage as they drove off. i didn't know people acted like that in real life.

4712,starbucks,"
as i have received the green light from the department to share the idea i had for the starbucks company, i will go ahead and describe what came to mind.
so, seeing as there are a lot of patrons that love their daily dose of caffeine before heading to work in the morning, or after a long day at the office, the idea came to mind after seeing the star system only allows you to get a drink each 150 stars, unlike some other competitors, you can get a free drink without having to spend 150$, 75$ or if you time it right with double star points and double stars per reload, it can be as low as 37.5$ 
that is still too much for people if you really think about it! per free drink i mean
so, my idea is to set up a beverage club, a special card customers will receive as soon as they sign up, with their very own member number that they can use while waiting for the card to arrive in the mail, they pay monthly, for a fee, say 60$ a month, that’s 2$ per drink, still lower than the 6$ venti people usually get! they get to use this card once a day to receive one free drink per day, any additional drinks that same day will be charged normally, but the beverage club will have a large success and i really see it blooming, i for one would love to see a beta version of this and see how many people would love to have it! 
maybe send out a survey and if it reaches a certain number of interested people maybe launch it! 
the club could be named “the starbucks insiders club” the name blooming from the fact that each person that would sign up for this club would be considered a member of the inside inner circle of starbucks patrons
man, i should really be a partner",the idea

the initial thought was to put water. but, if they wanted water they would’ve picked refresher and not lemonade. the other option was to put all base into it. but we didn’t really want to do that because we would run out faster than planned. the problem with this order was there was 2 of them. and they were venti’s.

after 5 minutes of all of us thinking about it we decided to just do it and give them all base. but we all mutually agreed if it said no ice we would’ve given them the correct amount of base for a venti and left the rest of the cup empty.

4726,starbucks,oof today’s shift was bad. like bad. i made some whip preps yesterday and measured incorrectly so redid them quickly. apparently they were all flat today  also rang up at least 8-10 drinks in drive incorrectly… thankfully both bars heard and made the right drinks but oh goodness i felt so awful at the end of my shift. wish i could make it up to the team for my mistakes this weekend ,today was not good…

my sm was in today when it happened, and she said that she ""legally wasn't allowed to ask if it's a service dog"" which is incorrect. the ada states that you can ask if it's a service dog, and what task it performs. after going back and forth with her a bit, she finally corrected herself that it was corporate policy not to ask. which feels icky, especially since she tried to insist that it was a legal thing at first.

i have good references and open availability (although, tbf, i am going back to school in abt a month and a half - which limits it).

but the two stores that i applied to for part time (night shifts) both rejected me.

4746,starbucks,"a few weeks ago my manager decided to transfer to a different store to help rebuild it i guess you can say. 
he hired someone else to take over our store and my schedule has been all messed up ever since it's on days i'm not available, before and after my availability times and i'm scheduled on days i'm not even supposed to be there and the new manager says it's my responsibility to get those shifts covered.
 even though she said she has my current availability. 

is it really my responsibility to get those shifts covered if they were agents my availability on the website?",is this allowed?
4747,starbucks,"so i was just written up for being late. one time was 15 minutes because of an error on the initial schedule that i had no control over. another time was 4 minutes because unfortunately i didn't plan on having the roads start construction with no notice. and one time i had to call off like an hour before my shift because i got sick and i woke up an hour before work.

this means i cannot apply for a promotion or transfer when i need to for the sake of my mental, physical, and financial health.

and now one of my coworkers who hasn't even been with the company 4 months is in line for a promotion. i just saw the interview take place today and i'm beyond livid.

my sm is willing to bend the rules for them but not for me. i almost filed a report with pcc and ethics &amp; compliance but i'm too scared to lose my job because i rely on benefits and will probably be relying on the health insurance eventually.

4748,starbucks,"my coworkers have developed a habit of opening up inclusion bags and not putting the berries into the inclusion containers — they just free-pour the berries into drinks.

i completely understand that it’s an annoying added step to put the berries in the container (especially during rush) and that sometimes the spoons get wet so the containers/berries get all gross and stuff.

but imo you just have to suck it up, clean it, and be more careful not to get liquid into the cases. personally, i find it a bit annoying to always have to free-pour the berries. sometimes it’s a struggle to find where the last person put the bag, and it tends to make drinks (especially mdr) inconsistent.

in my free time, i’ve been putting the berries into the containers, but my coworkers are so used to just free-pouring from the bag that they keep opening up new inclusion bags even though there are berries in the containers 

it’s not the end of the world to free-pour, but i personally would just prefer to use the spoons. what do you guys think? aita?",the inclusion containers exist for a reason…

“by continuing to work when he is sick without a workplace accommodation or communicating with other partners to that he did not pass the covid check in which leads to him falsifying the covid sign in sheet by working when actively vomiting. this behaviour is against our food safe and covid safety policy and could result in separation.”.

what are l's next steps? can they file for unemployment? will this impact their ability to get another job quickly, since in their separation letter, they accused him of violating the anti-harassment policy and failing to maintain the third place environment. they are enrolled in asu online school for the fall semester, and the tuition scholarship has already been granted, but the semester hasnt started, so theyre worried that will no longer be valid.",coworker/roommate just got fired over a cup

4790,starbucks,"the production and disposal of single use items like disposable cups bring several negative impacts on the environment, such as global warming and pollution. here are five reasons why these cups are so problematic: 

1. with coffee being the most popular beverage in america, over 100 billion cups are used every year.
2. 25 billion foam cups are consumed annually – they´re made of non-biodegradable petroleum-based plastic (polystyrene/styrofoam), containing toxic chemicals that can threaten human and animal health.
3. 58 billion paper cups are thrown away annually – most of them are plastic coated cups, which means they’re non-recyclable. 
4. 20 million trees are cut down and 12 billion gallons of water are used every year in order to make paper cups.
5. every four cups create 1 pound of co2 emissions.

in addition, paper, plastic and styrofoam cups cause the depletion of resources and add to the global landfill crisis.

how could that possibly be changed? by making paper cups recyclable, which means big companies like starbucks changing the plastic coated cups to eco-friendly alternatives. 

any thoughts on that?

4815,starbucks,"hi all, 368 here,

i have some ideas for mobile ordering that i believe would significantly better streamline the process and make things a lot easier for baristas. here's what i'm thinking:

1. **drink limits.** customers are to order no more than 5 beverages per order, and they cannot order any more from their starbucks account until they have picked up their first order.
2. **food limits.** warming baristas need help too! i recommend no more than 5 items total, and no more than two of one *type* of item (especially breakfast sandwiches) and able to be batched in groups of two per warming bag, where applicable. 
3. **customization limits.** customers cannot make more than 5 customizations to a beverage, particularly extra syrups and inclusions. along with this may be additional fees for specifications such as light/extra ice, blonde instead of signature, and extra pumps instead of the baseline amount per size.
4. **delivery order limits.** delivery customers should be allowed no more than, i think, 6 beverages and 6 food items. if delivery customers need more than 6 of either item, they will need to call the store ahead of time. and no cheating, either; they should only be able to call and order from one store only.
5. **(\*cafe only\*) no more than 5 iced or hot drinks per person.** a person should be allowed, at max, only 10 beverages, or 5 each hot and/or iced. any more and then they will have to make a separate transaction after receiving their first batch, or else have another person in their party make an order for themselves. i think the same limit of 5 items should be imposed for heated food, too.

i just was promoted to ssv a couple weeks ago and i get massive anxiety going to work now. i am so afraid of fucking up or having a bad shift and afraid that i am causing a bad shift for the baristas. i’m a closer and there’s this one morning shift that is so knit picky about every close and am terrified of what she might say about my close (she also literally has never closed before and i don’t think she actually understands how much there is to do at night and what it’s like). 

also the night crew at my store tends to be majority green beans, so it doesn’t help that i have to balance doing my shift tasks and basically walking all of my baristas through their shift and through closing. there’ll occasionally be at least 1 seasoned barista and the majority of the seasoned baristas will take initiative by themselves to do closing tasks and walk green beans through them and give them things to do, which helps a lot, but i then worry that they think i’m a bad shift because i should be doing that. 

i worry that my fellow shifts think i’m a bad shift.  tonight i screwed up the change order and now the safe is $100 over. my sm assured me it was fine and she would fix it, but i feel so much guilt and my fellow shift assured me that i wouldn’t get in trouble, especially because it wasn’t my responsibility as a closing shift to do the change order because the mid shift was supposed to do it. i’m trying to give myself some leeway because it was my first time doing it alone and things were hectic so i was stressed and messed up the counting, but i can’t stop telling myself i’m so stupid for screwing that up. 

i’m not sure if this is a good fit for me, but i don’t want to step down because i need the money. i’m upset that this isn’t going as well as i thought it would because i was a really good barista and i thought i could do it and i never ever believe in myself, so the one time i did, it turned out i was wrong. i go to bed and my heart won’t stop pounding and i can’t stop shaking and my thoughts won’t stop racing. it’s hard to sleep at night because of the intense amount of shame and guilt i feel.

we also had the ssv crafting experience training today with shifts from two other stores and i had an anxiety attack because of the immense pressure i feel to perform well from other shifts, baristas, my sm, my dm, and myself. it was embarrassing because everyone noticed i wasn’t okay, even the shifts from the other stores. they were all very concerned and even a couple of the shifts i don’t know from the other stores asked me if they could do anything to help me, which i appreciated, but i hate looking weak. it was embarrassing. i haven’t had an anxiety or panic attack in a year.",promotion is worsening my mental health

the drive thrus in our district will be opening later and our cafe store is being pushed up even though we get maybe 5 customers between open-6am. apparently that’s doing so good compared to our other stores that they’re rewarding our hard work by having us open earlier in hopes that we’ll get 6 customers between open-6am. every day i grow more and more tired. 

our store manager and district manager have been going to bat for us and even created spreadsheets about our customer count, trying to convince them to either keep our regular hours or have us open later and the higher ups straight up ignored it all and basically said ‘hm haha no u guys should suffer for being one of the higher earning stores thanks so much for your hard work congratulations’

i believe the system once wanted to charge $4.35 or something for a doppio with a handful of extras, and they berated me down to the $2.85 base price. i’m usually okay with sometimes undercharging as my trainer was alright with it (i hate to ask upwards of 7 dollars for some custom coffees) but this is getting a bit ridiculous and i’m tired of being lambasted for prices.

in my training i was told to just listen to what they have to say and “make it right” by removing the charges and making the drinks as requested. is this legit? is there another way to handle this? should i tell them they’re literally getting an iced white mocha and that i have to charge them for that?

i’m in a licensed store so no cup stickers &amp; we don’t have to be accurate on computer entry, therefore i have relative control of pricing and what extras get charged. i want to bring this up with my team lead but she is crazy busy and never really has the time. i’d love opinions though, thanks all",people arguing for cheap wms literally every day?

(if you've seen the boys, they were referring to that scene in s3 where he milks a cow and then just immediately drinks it). but jesus christ. if you've ever been to a local or **real** coffee shop, there is a reason they are probably using whole milk as the default. if you've ever seen an actual professional barista, there is a reason they are probably using whole milk for most of their drinks. actual coffee culture uses whole milk as its default because it both tastes best in drinks and steams best for art. there is a crapload of science behind this but no one ever cares because ""it's just an excuse for being disgusting."" starbucks is barely a coffee shop at best, and that is not a jab at the employees. this company just does a poor job training and teaching its employees and has many serious changes to make before it can even be close to an actual café.

4892,starbucks,"so our store got a new store manager (an outside hire), and he is horrendous. he shows up two or three hours late nearly every day and we rarely get breaks on time. he’s insanely slow with all positions, will put new food on top of used papers in the oven (eww) and constantly messes up ordering, so we don’t have ingredients like classic syrup. 

one day during a rush, he berates me for ringing up a triple espresso when the person wanted three single espresso shots (i work in an area with a lot of tourists, and not to demean anyone, but not all customers have the best english). 

then, he flips out and starts threatening me that “we aren’t having a second mistake” because i rang up a hot drink as an iced drink. i was visibly upset the whole day, while still having to get through lines of customers. and i said fuck this he doesn’t deserve me. found a store to transfer into and put in the request the next day; he got so intimidated by the fact that i made the choice. if i wasn’t doing the college achievement plan, i would have just walked out.

customer: pfft- really?? hahaha

( i don't  expect them to, i just appreciate it.) i just now found out that one of my favorite baristas there passed away, and i want to do something for the rest of the workers. is a card weird? they know my order when i come up to the window, and they're always so amazing, i just want to do something to show them they matter, and that they're  appreciated.",what is appropriate?

it happened again recently at my store and a partner told me about it. an hour later, when i was on the floor a man from out of state called and said his account was used and it wasn't him. i voided the card so now the individual that used multiple accounts has a card of $0 dollars. i did a digital incident report and my dm said moving forward that the person who calls we need to give them the 1800 number and let corporate handle it, they suspect the caller might be in on it too, but i don't see how more than one person would benefit if a void is done on the $100 gc and it's zeroed out.

4953,starbucks,"261 partner here. i've left starbucks twice. first time, i'd just gotten married, was newly promoted to ssv, and it was just too much for me at the time. i didn't have any time with my new husband and had to work holidays instead of spending them with him, so i left to work at a preschool. i enjoyed it at first, but i always compared it to my job at starbucks. i missed the stress and chaos that made work go by super quickly, and found myself extremely bored without it, not to mention my new coworkers were nothing like my old ones. 

i left that job and went back to my old starbucks store as a ssv, worked there for about a year before i left again because my sm quit and our store was, well, a sh*tshow, and i wasn't making enough for the work i was doing, and this was right around the time all of the union-busting was going on and i'm very pro-union and anti-corporate.

i've worked several jobs since, and i literally cannot find a job i like better. i miss the atmosphere and all of my old coworkers, i miss the flexibility of being able to ask time off, i miss the flexible hours and free coffee, and believe it or not i miss the stress i dealt with because i feel like i work better under stress and it helps time to by faster. 

i hate starbucks, i think they overwork and underpay their employees, and the whole corporation itself is shady.

4958,starbucks,just a customer here wondering if there’s any word on what the fall drinks and snacks are going to be :),fall menu?
4959,starbucks,"everyone here is blindfolded by their own ignorance. as a former barista, i see here customers who don’t understand anything about being a barista and how hard the job can be sometimes, as well as baristas who will complain about virtually anything. 

rarely on this sub you will find a middle ground of adequate baristas and customers, so i compiled a list of issues below from each side. feel free to add more in the comments:

customer’s issue:

1. my order is taking too long!!1!1!1
ma’am, starbucks can get very busy even in your buttfuckiville indiana. you’re not the only person who wants coffee in the morning. instead of fuming in the drive through, order ahead with mobile app. still though, sometimes the wait is so long, you’ll need to wait. if your cat is giving birth/kid graduating high school/you need to land a space shuttle in 10 minutes, consider leaving and coming back later. explain that you missed your order and kindly ask if baristas can do a remake. likely they will.

2. am i an asshole for ordering this drink 
no you’re not. baristas are paid to make drinks, you don’t have to apooogise for ordering one. just be polite and considerate. say please and thank you. pay with starbucks app if possible because it’s quickest. 

3. why is it so expensive??
corporate raised prices. we don’t charge you extra and pocket the difference i promise you. your feelings are justified, just don’t direct them at the baristas as we have no recourse with prices. contact corporate and complain to them, explain how you can’t afford to go anymore. complaining here is also appropriate if you just want to vent. this sub is for baristas and customers alike. 

baristas issues: 
1. i hate cleaning!!! we have to do so much but get paid so little it’s so ridiculous!!!!! late stage capitalism aaaaah!!
this is a response to a recent post someone made lol. i’ll say something extremely unpopular here, but here it goes. there is no job that’s not office/corporate where you don’t have to be versatile (meaning you don’t have to clean, stock, ring register, help customers at the same time). any other job - mcdonalds, dunkin donuts, walmart, chipotle all require similar job responsibilities, and all of them suck. a lot of people came to starbucks thinking they’ll be doing latte art, but of course reality is not that at all. so if you’re really unhappy with your starbucks job, i consider quitting (but not for another job like dunkin donuts) but for an office/corporate job. 

2. customers dont even know what goes in shaken espresso ahahahahaha
bitch sit down and calm your tits. i hate snobby people and this is such snobbish shit at its best. half of you don’t know what a deductible is, or what goes into your panera soup, or what is under the hood of your car. you know why? because just like customers didn’t go through starbucks training, you didn’t go through claims adjuster/panera/mechanics training. and it’s normal to not know, it’s not criminal. if you want to educate the customer, explain nicely, but don’t act like you’re better than everyone. 

3. general hate for customers 
i understand that sometimes you really want some downtime to lean against the wall and chill for a sec. it’s valid and understandable. but at the end of the day you’re there to work, that’s what you’re paid to do, and you have to face customers/make drinks/clean bathrooms. yes sometimes customers are rude and i’ll be first one in line to cuss them out, but otherwise cmon man, you signed up for the job and you’re still working there, put some effort in. if you don’t like it then consider leaving, because working at a place that you hate only makes you more tired/frustrated and customers then get bad service. no one wins at the end of the day.","calm your tits, people. (trenta post)"
4960,starbucks,today we had a new shift supervisor open for the first time by herself today. she shouldn’t of opened on her own today cuz she’s only been with company for 3 weeks but my store is going to shit so… she doesn’t even know how to use inventory management or that an order had to placed. when i came in at 12:30 she told me this and the cut off time had already passed. tbh i don’t really know much about ordering because i don’t open and i want to know what’s gonna happen. will we just not get a truck?,order wasn’t placed: what happens?
4961,starbucks,"recently i transferred to a new starbucks in my area. this store is literal shit. ppl always trash talking each other. super bad
management and overall just bad vibes in general. a complete 360 from the location i used to work at. i’ve been reaching the end of my rope with this place and im thinking of either quitting or transferring somewhere else. anyways i saw a shift was open on the sbuxpartnerhrs app for a mid shift 10:30-2 and picked it up more than a week ago. today i show up at my shift and apparently the manager double scheduled someone else at the same time. however when i see she crossed out my name is sharpie and wrote someone else’s name im livid. she didn’t bother sending a simple text hey someone else is scheduled for that time don’t worry abt it. instead she doesn’t bother saying anything. i show up and the shift has to call her to check in the middle of peak. gas is so freaking expensive and this location isn’t really close to my house. so i texted my manager and asked if she could compensate me for gas. my friend told me that was inappropriate to ask. what do y’all think?",manager double-scheduled on my shift.

4963,starbucks,"hello all! 

i've been trying to make healthier substitutions whenever i order but i realized it's not as straight forward as it seems. i recently found out that drinks have full pumps and half pumps of syrup, and they don't specify on the app which one you're getting. i had no idea that starbucks did half pumps and i don't know how to account for that when counting calories. 

i'd order a grande shaken espresso, for example, and see that it has 4 pumps of vanilla. turns out that means half pumps or 2 actual full pumps. i was under the impression that it was 4 full pumps, which is 80 calories. meanwhile it's more like 40 calories. so when i've been substituting half the pumps for sugar-free, i've been miscalculating how many to put. also, if i add a different flavor, will that also be given as a half pump or will that one be full? do only certain flavors get half? this is so confusing for someone who isn't a barista.

can anyone provide some insight into this system?? how do i know which drinks get half and which don't? how can i account for calories?

much thanks in advance!!!",calorie counting.. half pumps??

4970,starbucks,"y'all what is the proper way to make this. i ordered this the first time about a week ago and have had it probably 4 times since then. every single time it has been made differently and i can't find a drink card on it. 

from my understanding of when i worked there in college, you'd just do straight nitro cold brew and a layer of vanilla sweet cream foam on top. the nitro would eventually separate into a nice dark body with crema on top.

but today i got one with ice. they remade it and said it was nitro but it looked like a an iced latte. light tan, no body.

last week i had one with nitro and liquid cream poured into it. 

i had another that was nitro with 2 pumps of vanilla syrup added to it and vanilla cream added. 

what is it?",vanilla sweet cream nitro cold brew

4975,starbucks,"as the title states, i plan to connect with my dm regarding their denial of my transfer request to the store that is extremely close to where i live.

currently, the store i work at is about an hour and a half commute (bus, as i don’t own a car) and since i have to take two busses, it has caused me to become late due to the busses arriving late sometimes or having other complications.

recently, last month, my sm wrote a corrective action (1st one) regarding my tardiness, and i explained to her the situation. she seemed understanding and in full support of me transferring.

the store next to my house is a 25 minute walk or one bus. it would help me immensely.

the store manager for the store that i want to transfer to is in full support of it as well. 

however, the dm denied the request due to my recent corrective action regarding being late…

… even though that’s the entire reason and point of the transfer.

i talked to another sm about it and she said that it’s policy to wait 6 months after a corrective action but that it ultimately lies on the dms decision. 

i texted her in hopes of connecting the next opportunity that me and her get.

i plan to highlight how this is imperative for my success.

4976,starbucks,so a partner at our store tested positive and our sm told us that most of us have to wear masks although most of that group hasn’t been in contact with her for 48 hours or more since she tested positive. if we haven’t been in contact for more then 48 hours do we still have to wear a mask at work? there is no mask mandate in our state our county right now.,mask procedure after covid exposure
4977,starbucks,"hey. so, i began working on my college starbucks 4 months ago. i really like the job but i sometimes get distracted and mess up (i have severe adhd). i consider myself very hard-working and always take the initiative to help out. the issue is that when i started working i wasn't given a training package nor a starbucks shirt (which i still haven't been given one) and was trained for like 3 days. i also feel left out by my coworkers. i try to be nice and respectful to them but they are sometimes rude (like they turned off the lights while i was still washing dishes) and are pretty indifferent towards me (even when i make an effort to be nice and friendly). this has kinda affected my performance since i'm constantly overthinking this and due to being distracted i make mistakes. understandably, my coworkers get frustrated with me and explain to me the same process over and over (even the simplest things). they also stare at me while i make drinks which makes me anxious. i am aware they do this to help me but this makes me very anxious and nervous, since they tell me things i already know which is counterproductive to their time and mine. as i said, i'm very hard-working, always willing to learn new things and i currently think i have improved and feel very confident in bar (i might make some mistakes but that's it). i feel sometimes they are too harsh to me. i also feel that i have been neglected by starbucks (not being trained properly since the beggining, ignoring me, just assigning closing shifts now at l this point. i recognize i've gain a reputation but and i know my partners just want the team to work but the fact that i am constantly being monitored even when i'm doing things right and the fact that i feel i cannot make mistakes and others can is making me very anxious because as i said i tried my best to be good, or even perfect. i still have to learn how to brew coffee and some other stuff and i am willing to take my partner's help in that department.

the manager spoke to me saying that several leads have complained saying that after four months things are not sticking in my head. she also some people don't wanna work with me because they have to ""train me"" all the time. that they have invested time and money to train me and that my paychecks have just being for being trained (which is partially not true because i work a lot and thing i'm valuable in the team). she also said that she thought about transferring me but that she doesn't wanna give up on me yet. she wants to work on accomodations (which i found very nice of her part). she told me to email her about what i think would be best for me. i have been thinking about some ideas. i don't wanna victimize myself or be rude. i know i can do better and i want to be better.

sorry for the grammar mistakes i'm just ranting.",my coworkers don't like working with me and the manager just had a conversation with me
4978,starbucks,is it normal to be scheduled for training when you transfer to a new store if you’ve been working for over a year?,scheduled for training at a new store?
4979,starbucks,"the same people who clean the toilets and trash are the same people serving your coffee and food, and it's not a secret that most people don't even wash their hands as well/as often as they should.    


what's also gross is that you're expected to be the busboy, cook, make coffee, clean everything in the store, be cashier/therapist for the ~~needy leeches~~  customers who never stfu, restock supplies, make sure the bar has everything needed, the list is never ending all for way below a livable wage. had to work 6 or 7 jobs essentially while being harassed by shift supervisors for $11hr.  absolute fucking joke.

4980,starbucks,i have heard now from multiple sources that corporate is implementing a new policy that all partners must work a minimum of 16 hours each week. and that partners who can’t meet the requirement will be fired. if this is true then 1) it seems really sketchy and 2) like a third of my store will be fired. i’m a student and can only work 10 hours during the school year despite being one of the veteran partners at my store so this seems really unfair.,has anybody else heard about the new minimum hours requirement?!

4983,starbucks,"i’m sure it was horrible for everyone, but i just wanted to complain. it was just me and another girl as shift today, and both of us are barely out of our ssv training. the other experienced ssv got covid and no one else was available but the other new ssv. i also never worked mids very often as a barista and haven’t worked a mid in months, only closes. i understood what barista tasks got done during mid shifts (foh floors and bathrooms), but i did not have a grasp of what the mid shift’s shift tasks were.  i’m very experienced with closing and closing tasks that need to be done and when they need to get done by to have a good close and understood as a barista what shift tasks there were to do during closing shifts and a general idea of when they’re done, so it was very challenging as all my training shifts were closing shifts (plus the practice opening shift).  i did not get one practice shift for a mid even though i generally did not work mids often enough to know them well. 


anyway, so i got there at 12, it was packed. we usually start doing foh floors at 12/12:30ish, but we were no where near capable of sending someone to do a section of floors and being able to keep up with business, but no big deal, it’s fine if we start a little later. i was on front and food. i had a line of cafe, drive thru, and mobile food orders, the majority of which had to be warmed, so nothing that is quick to grab and hand out. it took forever for me to get food because there were so many people coming in, but we didn’t have enough staffed to have its own warming person. meanwhile, my sm had scheduled me and 4 other people for our pay increase conversations during this shift, meanwhile we have to run like 4 10s, and with a limited amount of staff, it was very difficult to plan out when we should send people on their 10s or send people to talk to the sm. we tried our best and got done with what we had. we didn’t get to starting the first section of foh floors until around 3. 


we were running out of so much. we were getting low on iced coffee and i didn’t have time to even make more. it felt like it took me 45 minutes to brew the iced coffee and make it. we ran out of sfv and i had to step off the floor to call around to other stores for more. and then a woman gets rear-ended in the drive thru and i had to fill out an incident report. 


our ice machine is broken and the repair men are basically saying it’s not and refuse to fix it for some reason. we ran out of ice, but had to figure out who we could send to buy more ice as this would cause a lot of problems due to the tuesday 50% off cold drinks. so i decide i’ll go on my 10 and get ice (the other shift made me take a 10 after i got back since that wasn’t a real break). i’m gone for like 25 minutes getting 15 bags of ice at walmart. i come back and i have to lug all these bags of ice inside from my car to inside our store.


i get back and we’re out of lemonade, peach juice, oatmeal (nbd no one ever orders oatmeal at my store anyway), lime bars, coffee base, tomato mozzarella, strawberry acai, mango dragonfruit inclusions, and half the protein boxes). my sm was able to grab us sfv from another store. we also have to pull, clean, and make 3 toddies. 


while my sm was at the other store picking up sfv, she had to have a conversation with their sm because one of the baristas from their store worked at our store last week and something happened. the other ssv was out at 3. my sm comes back upset and saying she was embarrassed by the conversation with the other sm. my sm just wanted to go home, but i had to remind her she had to teach me how to do the change order since i was never taught during my training. so my sm stayed and taught me how to do the change order. my sm leaves. 


it’s 3:45 and the closing shift comes in and i’m out at 4. i was so relieved to see them. 4 comes around and i’m so ready to leave, but then we realize that a barista who was supposed to be here at 3:45 isn’t here. we call them, they don’t answer. no call no show. (they almost walked out last tuesday and i honestly don’t blame them for not coming, half off cold drinks tuesday’s are the worst shifts to work) i offered to stay until 8 because i felt bad because that barista was supposed to close and the other closer is a green bean, and although i really wanted to leave, i need the hours. 


i’m supporting on cafe/mobile orders on bar meanwhile i have about 14 mobile order tickets stuck on the counter because no one marked out lemonade or strawberry acai, and with each person that walked in the store, i checked with each of them if they were there picking up one of those mobile orders we can’t make and discussing with them what they want to do instead, while also simultaneously trying to make drinks quickly. i had an obnoxious kid asking me to put whipped cream on his parent’s iced coffees (when i tell you he was being obnoxious, i mean it. my coworker loves kids and tolerates them pretty well, but even she said he was obnoxious). 


we try to get hot bars done, but we have a green bean doing dishes and they’re not very efficient with washing dishes so they don’t put all the hot bar pieces in the dishwasher at once. they put them in one load at a time while washing other unrelated task dishes. i get sent on my lunch. 


the rest of the shift didn’t go too bad until we ran out of whipped cream and couldn’t find the time to make more at the moment. thankfully, by the time i was out (which was an hour before close) they had caught up on all the tasks and were halfway through the restock. 


as everyone else has said, 50% of cold drinks every tuesday in july is bs. they understaff us every time and we are not capable of keeping up with the demand. i hate feeling watched by every single customer in the store because they don’t care that we are understaffed and somehow believe they could keep up with it. we are trying our best with what we are given.

your staff is miserable. nobody wants to be here. everyone is burnt out. we do so much business, but are only allocated a certain amount of hours and it never feels like we have enough people on the floor. it's like this at *every* high volume store i've been to. there is so much unnecessary, petty drama on the floor between partners. there's no trust. and management can't seem to figure out how to solve the fucking problem, because they're part of the problem. i am so tired of putting myself out there for people, trying to be the middle man, facilitating things between people, opening and closing the store in the same day due to call outs, only to be told i'm ""not helpful""? and given a final because i missed one covid check in throughout the entire month. my own manager talking shit behind my back, saying they don't ""believe"" i need to go on family medical leave, and that i've fabricated what i'm going through. 

*bitch it's not your job to speculate or verify the legitimacy of my leave.* it's sedgwick's. that's why we have sedgwick! i trusted my manager, too. i really did. never in a million years did i think i'd be running to my dm to report all this shit they don't know about, but here we are. this isn't the first pos manager i've had the misfortune of reporting, either. i have ethics and compliance saved as a contact in my phone, at this point i feel like we're besties.

despite all the shit, i loved this company and the people i worked with for three years. i wanted to believe i could be the kind of leader who people would trust to come to, the kind of person that fosters a healthy work environment that people felt happy and safe to be in. but it's just a revolving door of shit, and i'm burnt out. i'm so tired of trying to keep my chin up and push through. thank you for the free therapy though, my therapist is amazing.","26xxxxx here, riding out the rest of my loa, and that's it. i'm done. 🖕🏼"

how hostile are veteran crews to an outside manager coming in? what's a good way to integrate into an existing team, and are there any conversations i should be having week 1 with the partners and shift leads? what do you actually do most days, ha.

for partners, what do you expect of a new manager? how am i going to be judged, fairly and unfairly? i know from experience that coming into a store often means there's some existing dysfunctions, because unless it's brand new they need a new manager for a reason. would you feel more reassured by someone who puts out the vibe they know everything there is to know ( hard to imagine after 8 weeks of training), or who is willing to admit when they need to lean on someone else's experience?","hired as a manager pending the background check, coming from outside retail, how do i not fuck this up?"

i just don’t think 12 hours a week will be doable for me with a full time teaching job, and i will definitely be leaving if that’s the case. it seems like they’re screwing over other seasonal workers like college/high school students too. doesn’t seem like the typical union busting shenanigans since they usually have been targeting full timers instead. heck, 3 ssvs and at least 5 baristas at my store have all been consistently working less than 12 hours a week for the past few months.

5031,starbucks,"tldr; i went to treatment unexpectedly and was unable to fill out my loa or medical leave paperwork. my manager told me it was unnecessary and everything was fine, except oops, you lost your raise because you (or your abusive parents) didn’t file any paperwork. what do i do

in october, i was taken by transporters (came in at 2am, no warning) to a (primitive) wilderness therapy program. i stayed there 13 weeks, and afterwards i was sent to a year long transition program but only stayed there a month and a half. i was 16 when i was transported and i celebrated my birthday in february. i knew my mom had the power to apply for medical leave or a loa for me while i was literally miles from powerlines or roads that weren’t dirt. i begged her over letters, which had a weird delay because of the therapist giving me their letters and mine going out the same day, meaning i couldn’t reply until another week later; that made solid answers take two or more weeks to get to me. the only actions she took were calling my manager twice (he didn’t pick up) and visiting my store once just to ask for him and only telling one shift where i went. obviously i was sent in part because of my awful relationship with my parents, and at the time i really couldn’t trust them for shit. my mom kept forgetting and eventually i just gave up. after i got home, march 1st, i took time to adjust to life back at home before trying to get back with starbucks. my manager from before (who literally felt more like a father to me than my own) transferred to another store ~30 min away and was replaced by steve. obviously this was gonna be an obstacle but i had no idea how huge. i started applying and lobbying the shit out of steve to help me (getting the option to apply took weeks on its own, the system was messed up and there was no option to apply as a barista when i looked up my store. steve acted like this was completely out of his power and it took me roping in my old manager who had his own things going on at his own store to get that option up.) after i applied successfully, i had to do it again because steve couldn’t find it. a few more weeks of badgering him for an interview, and i got my first sip on memorial day. and my sister in law pointed out to me that i shouldve gotten an interview so i could discuss my pay and have a chance to negotiate it. weeks later, after seeing my paycheck and feeling the suspicion that not everything was back to normal, i asked steve to check my hourly pay in front of me, just in case. and my fears were right, i was back at base pay. 
brief wage history: i started at 10.50 5/11/2021, then in august there was a regional base pay raise to 12 and partners in the region hired before july something 2021 got a percentage bonus because we were doing spectacularly in sales, so i went up to 12.60$. 
i’m so overly pissed. i had asked steve how i could apply for a past medical leave or if there’s any paperwork i can do to mark myself as not fired and in treatment from october-march and he said “we’ll deal with that when you get hired”, “we’ll deal with that later”, “oh! you don’t need to do that, you’re back as everything’s normal, you were marked as rehirable so it’s not a stain on your record.” and then when i asked to see my pay and he blubbered an explanation, he said that because i didn’t do loa or medical leave paperwork i lost that raise. so i did fucjing need it!!! and nows when he tells me oh we can’t go back in time to do that, it’s beyond my power, but i’ll call partner resources and try i guess. i have to come up to him because he hasn’t gotten back to me at all, and that’s when i corner him in the back room asking him what’s the update. the way he spoke i’m so sure he actually didn’t do shit. and he treated me like i was being petty, 60 cents is so small and you’re getting the raise to 15 on august 1st anyways! even though i’ve been back  almost 2 months and that fucking makes a difference. steve keeps saying things are out of his power as an excuse.. does he not realize he’s two levels above me and if he can’t reach up there i sure as fuck can’t? and i know there’s never nothing to be done, especially in special cases like mine. i’m so fucking distraught, after missing actual months of work being in treatment, i come home and i have to work to get everything back to normal, and i’m finally told great!! after working your ass off everything is back to normal even though it fucking wasn’t. i just know my old manager would’ve had my raise reinstated and i would’ve been compensated for the time i didn’t have it by now. please help me.",lost my raise due to an unexpected medical leave.. and i had no clue. please help

5058,starbucks,"so, i am a recently promoted ssv. i got done with my training two weeks ago and they were looking to hire another ssv because a bunch just left our store. specifically, they are looking for a barista that can work mids and closes, while occasionally a few opens. we have a new sm that started around the time i interviewed for the promotion. she interviewed two baristas i work with. 

barista #1: is a hard worker, knows the ins and outs of starbucks, does a lot of coaching, and is a barista trainer. can work opens, mids, and closes and is well-versed in all 3. always works with a sense of urgency and takes a lot of initiative. has had ssv experience before at another coffee shop. 

barista #2: has only worked opens and mids, has never closed before. has a huge attitude and rolls their eyes whenever anyone (regardless of if they’re a barista or an ssv) asks them to do their job and occasionally laughs and says no. we’ve had a problem with their behavior after they sexually harassed one of their trainees to the point where the trainee (who worked with us for like 5 months) just quit because they can’t stand working with barista #2 anymore. (i think our old sm knew about this, but our new sm definitely doesn’t)

guess who our sm promoted?

barista #2

a lot of us believe this is straight up favoritism because our sm works with barista #2 a lot and of course when the sm is there, barista #2 actually does their job and acts like they are a great employee. our sm rarely works with barista #1. 

another ssv and i asked our manager if we could have a conversation with her about our concerns about barista #2’s promotion, but now i’m starting to worry this will reflect badly on my part. i just do not think barista #2 is capable or deserving of the promotion and a lot of the closing baristas have issues about it too. 

my other ssv that i’m going to be having the conversation with our sm with said that they’ve done this in the past where they brought up concerns about another ssv, but to be fair, he was making customers and baristas uncomfortable and would literally talk to our regulars about having an std, which starbucks is not the time nor place to talk about that stuff , especially with a customer. 

was this a bad idea? our sm has agreed to talk to us. i don’t want my sm thinking i have it out for barista #2 or am trying to get them to change their mind, they just genuinely don’t realize that this is what barista #2 is like when they’re not around.",ssv in need of advice
5059,starbucks,"question to my fellow canadian partners. i am not yet ready to tell my manager, but i may be moving a couple cities over (about 2 hours away) as soon as november.

i am wondering if it is worth bothering to transfer to another city or not. is that something partners can do easily enough in the first place?

two factors that make this even more difficult:

i am just about to come back to starbucks after a long loa (parental leave).

and my partner is adamant about taking a 2 week trip to another country so our baby can meet their relatives. if we move, the trip will happen right after we move out/before we move to new home. if we don't move, thr trip will probably still happen (i am also anxious about asking for that time off so soon after my loa, especially when i used all my vacation time before my maternity leave.)

at this rate i'm wondering if i should just quit. but i like starbucks and i'd hate to have no job to come home to.

so, partners, is transfering even a realistic option in the first place? how about in this wild situation?",should i transfer if i'm moving cities?

5094,starbucks,"i'm not sure if this fits here but don't know where to go to talk about what's going on in my store. 

we have problem customers, like every other store. a gentleman comes in 5 times a week for a hot cinnamon dolce. he mobile orders maybe 15-20 minutes before he arrives, so when he gets here, all of the foam and whip are gone/ melted. he complains about this, every single day he's here.

one of our partners who is an absolute sweetheart and amazing with customer connection tried to explain that if he doesn't want all that room, that ordering no foam and no whip will guarantee a perfect drink every time. his response was ""i shouldn't have to do your job for you!"" and he stormed out.

yesterday, i was making drinks and didn't realize who's drink i pulled, so i made it like normal, whip, foam, the works. now, i'm not the best bar partner, but i loved bar, and i've never received a complaint about too much foam on my drinks before. i try and be careful to give people the amount they ordered if that makes sense. 

but anyways, i'm continuing my bar life all fine when this customer comes in. he grabs his drink, opens the top, and immediately looks angry. i go to ask what the problem is, but he turns and heads straight to our manager. 

not a problem, the manager is probably just explain what all of us have been explaining, right?

wrong.

he comes over and asks me to put only streamed milk in to top off the cup. i mean, we told him to order without whip, but if you say so boss! the amount of room left was maybe a little more than an inch. not crazy if you understand hot drinks (at least i think so?). i fill his grande and go back to my thing. 

after he leaves my manager come over to talk to me. he told me the amount of room in the cup was ""excessive"" and that, from now on, i have to do no foam for every single hot drink. only me. no one else on the floor was told this. i spent the next part of my shift attempting this idea and, not only was it slowing things down like crazy, my bar was constantly covered in milk from me scooping out foam.

by the end of the day, i wanted to cry. i had multiple people get angry about times and the fact that i can't do my favorite position anymore makes me... just want to quit.

idk if anyone's made it this far in, but what should i do? i don't want to quit and i can't keep up this no foam idea feasibly.",bar is ruined for me

my name is l, my coworker, we'll call him m, reported me for sexual harassment about two weeks ago and insisted that my sm doesn't speak to me about it or even mention it. m mentioned two things, us talking about his cuts and his private sex life. 

this conversation was months ago and while i may have mentioned his cuts that day i was very careful to be as respectable as possible. the conversation lasted at most three minutes and the last that i remember is him saying he's quit since last january (which is awesome!) now regarding the private sex life, i don't need nor want to know what you do or what sex your partner is but, i understand sensitivity can be a very delicate topic.

i'm willing to say that the conversation might have moved to a sexual place (at most asking if he had a partner) but again i have no desire into knowing your ins and outs. now, had i known m felt this way i would have immediately apologized contritely but m doesn't want me to know. that's fine, but do not ever f%&amp;@king send anyone after me to fix your ""problem"" again.

he made this report around the beginning of july after coming back from a month's leave. again i was not informed about this harassment until july 10th, the day after one of m's friends stalked me from my store for 15 minutes. i honestly don't even want to write about it cause so much happened.

he was waiting for me at the door while interrogating my sm asking her why i haven't been fired yet. that's all i heard from the conversation and sm lets me out when he leaves. mind you i'm as clueless as a capybara at this moment but, it would have been great to be told what was going on, especially since it regards me.

after 15 minutes i notice what was going on so i just confronted him. immediately he started in an aggressive tone (l, hey you know you shouldn't say those things, l you're making all of your coworkers uncomfortable, l you're a fucking creep, l you shouldn't be working there). my favorite one was, (you don't know what you did?!?!) no, i'm sorry could you please be more descriptive! 

knowing what sex he was talking about would have really helped though, it wouldn't have stopped his rage. after i was constantly denying his vague allegations and gaslighting he finally just smacked my phone out of my hand and kicked the drink i had in a bag all over myself. i was enraged but i was more confused than anything cause i know i'm not either of those disgusting things.

i filed a police report, returning back to work the next day involuntarily agitated. this is where my sm finally tells me what's going on. i spoke to her respectfully expressing that this type of behavior outside is way beyond the line and that you can't gatekeep information at its most pivotal moment especially if it is concerning me. m is still working there reprimand-free due to some legal reasons i'm assuming. but if this happened in any other non-corporate his ass would have been thrown.

honestly, i'm writing this cause i have no fight in me anymore and i'm planning on quitting in the coming time anyways. this violation is just another box to add to the already over-checked list of issues with this company (sorry howard).

so i leave you with my story so that we may discuss it professionally in the comments.

and to any charitable individuals that i would consider a friend please be careful out there. no matter anywhere in life there will be incredibly sensitive situations in which you must set your pride aside on. m couldn't give me the respect i deserved but all it did was make me stronger. i have a newfound confidence in life because i didn't feel like a victim. m clearly felt like one and i hope it stays in its head like a neverending bad dream. i've learned to let go however, i feel like he should be fired.",coworker sends its friend after me. what's your crazy work drama?

5114,starbucks,"hey all ssv’s out there! do you ever feel like that ever since you’ve been promoted, some people have painted a target on your back?
a lot of us, including me, at my store are either in college or work part time. only a few have made this their career (which is super cool!). but it’s those who aren’t planning to make this their career who do the most. 
i got promoted in january and i really have been loving it, i love most people here, and i have so much fun on all my shifts when i am key-holder! i’ve been complimented lots on my work style and i genuinely feel liked by at least 95% of the staff due to all the positive feedback. 

the 5%, have made it really hard for me the past while, especially lately and find so many opportunities to bring me down. i find my boss is having to talk to me lots about their complaints and it’s always the people (including one ssv) who have bullied many others that many people have problems with. i know this because i was once that barista who was bullied by this same person and have been told stories by others. 

i made amends with them by approaching them one on one and fixing it months ago. 
but today, they caused an issue where the dm has to get involved now and i spent my whole day crying. i wish i didn’t care so much but it’s been bringing everyone down including me. i’m just very drained from it all. and my boss knows that i am not the issue and she told me to take some time and put my mental health first. it’s been ever since my promotion where things have gotten so bad with a couple of people ganging up on me and dragging me into issues where i try to just walk away from. 
i’m just trying to make my money and go home but this place is consuming me because i want to do a good job and get along with everyone! after today i can feel myself getting so cold and i basically need advice lol. 
i’ve been told that people really like me and i noticed this other ssv hasn’t gotten the same feedback that i have over the months of my promotion and it almost feels like a jealousy thing? even when i get along with people they dislike, they would bring it to my attention that it’s an issue and that it bothers them. i never know how to react to that because i am so flabbergasted that that’s a real, genuine reaction to something that doesn’t concern them. 

 (pls note that not everyone likes me but i do feel like a lot of people do because i genuinely care about them and am positive/apologize when i mess up)

i never get mad at people. i never lash out. i coach when needed and do my job as efficiently as possible. i can take constructive criticism. i care so so so much and maybe that’s the issue. 

i just never have met someone who seeks out opportunities to hurt others and then play victim when it benefits them. it feels personal. sometimes i wish i was a barista again instead. maybe then i wouldn’t be brought down so much? i wonder if i am the issue in the workplace and i don’t see it? i really don’t know what i did to be so disliked by this particular ssv.

5253,starbucks,"three months ago i started full-time employment as an operations coordinator in the tech sector and left starbucks a few weeks ago. i had my first performance review today. it was overly positive - because of traits i picked up at starbucks. 

resourcefulness - we’ve all macguyvered a cold brew contraption, we research online barista communities for help, and starbucks provides lots of information in different places we have to hunt for. 

consistency - hello, standards! being able to be consistent with your work is a huge selling point. 

multitasking - if you can leave shots to pull and put food in the oven while taking a drive thru order, you can write an email while sitting in on a meeting. 

openness to any task - nothing is too big or too small to take on. 50 drinks in a mobile order, to scrubbing toilets, to training the next generation of beans. you’re not scared. 

productivity - when the drive thru dragon of 45 cars in half an hour is terrorizing your dreams, friday deliverables are a breeze.

5274,starbucks,"hello! 

so here's my situation, i transferred from a starbucks i had been working at since july to another starbucks in december, with that i was given more hours and was properly trained at the new store. at first i loved the manager and loved all my coworkers and even loved the area and regulars. 

since then it's changed, the manager who i used to love has started scheduling me less starting back in april due to 3 sick callouts while also has scheduled me to retrain on bar next week even though honestly i personally think i'm pretty okay at. my only issue is when i wasn't medicated which i started medication like two weeks ago, i would get very stressed during peak, but i could kind of manage. i do not think that is worth 8 hours of retraining either. my manager has scheduled me for at most 10-15 hours a week even though my availability is all day every day. 

coming up is when i will not be able to really work weekdays and i told him that on the weekends i would love to be able to work at least 6 hour shifts a day. he told me that because of that bar retraining he's hesitant to schedule me for more hours and told me a shift told him i said a few times i was tired after a longer shift and basically said that unless i can really work hard for those hours he will not schedule me for longer shifts. 

recently, i worked at my old store and they are currently in the process of getting a new manager and when i worked an 8 hour shift there i helped train a new partner on bar, was very productive, overall, i just had a really good time. the ssv there even told me she saw potential in me to be a trainer and possibly a ssv when i turn 18. the entire shift had me thinking about how i'm so tired of how my manager doesn't schedule me even though i've asked a few times, and i get so incredibly stressed out at this location.

i want to transfer, i miss my old coworkers as well, but, some things are holding me back such as how acessible it is to get to my current store, my current store has the newer machines (ovens, manstrettas, etc.) while my old store doesn't. those are really the only things holding me back and of course my coworkers. i just feel like i shouldn't have to stay at a store i'm not happy and while transportation is easier to manage than my old store, i don't want to feel like i have to prove myself in a way to even get hours. please, help me make this decision please.",considering transferring (again lol)

5280,starbucks,"so i recently moved go washington. i’ve been here since the 1st and i now work at a license store as a shift. before i moved here  i was an assistant for a license store so i know the starbucks standard very well and i also know that the store will operate different since it’s not in a grocery store like my previous store. anyways, since i started working here i’ve been micromanaged on everything. when they can’t talk because they don’t do a lot of things right according to starbucks standard. we use the book/ipad for temps only. clean plays aren’t used and nothing is being communicated through the book. it’s quite literally empty besides temps. not only that they way drinks are made is just stressful to watch. example : shaken espresso‘s are made by syrup in a cup then espresso directly in the shaker then ice and shake. …??? like no.  day 2 of me being there the privilege to eat anything on shift whether it be from home or from the store has been taken away. unless you take a 30 unpaid break. which would bring employees to less than 6 hour shifts. not only that but my roommates parter and i carpool sometimes since we don’t have cars today i brought my partner into work since i couldn’t bring him home first dude to timing and gas. i told them they could sit in the lobby till i was done. this is something i’ve always done. at my last store and previous coffee shops i’ve worked at. they bought a drink and a food item so there was no loitering. they were reading minding their own business across the store not talking to me. and the manager told me he’s not allowed to be in the store and made them leave. i’m sorry but that is ridiculous. i have never heard that. who are they to kick a paying customer who isn’t distracting out ? the other partners have been rude and micromanaging me on things they do even do to starbucks standard. the main concern is making sure there is a dot on flat whites. not cleanliness. i deep cleaned the entire bar and was asked why. i feel like i’m being dramatic but as someone who use to help run a store this has been an agonizing week to watch. i’m really bad at quitting jobs due to anxiety. a part of me just wants to never go back and not say anything but the other part of me knows it’s wrong and i’m not sure if i should wait it out and see if it gets better or just leave.",is it wrong to want to ghost my starbucks ?

5291,starbucks,"i've been working in the 'bux for a while and it's great. new coworkers come and leave, the old ones are nice as always and they're here for a reason.

a majority of my coworkers are nice, but a few are getting on my nerves with the way they are acting. i really do appreciate the ones who are polite and don't cause problems.

in one case, my usual shift lead favors one employee and allows them to not work for several hours. the lead also sit in the back playing games on their phone for hours. when i relax even after cleaning everything, i get scolded. lead ignores me/gives silent treatment to be petty. in fact, they even left the store once and left us baristas ""as a joke"". whines about wanting to quit. tells me about their life and how miserable they feel. lowers the morale of our coworkers in general, but a good worker.

a few girl coworkers seem to dislike me. they always make off-hand comments with a sarcastic tone. whenever they see me, they start furiously typing on their phone. they give me the silent treatment, but they seem afraid of me and shy away. they will always mention how ""i don't work enough or make enough money"" even though i have another job. questions about me becoming a shift lead (which i don't want at all) because they couldn't become one. 

i also reported someone for sexual harassment and somehow everyone in the store found out. it made me extremely uncomfortable that they started joking about it to me. it feels slightly traumatizing. it also feels unfair that another coworker (one of the girls mentioned) reported several cases of harassment, but no one made fun of it. it felt disrespectful.

at first i didn't mind, but as things build up it's starting to get to my head. i really like my sbux location, so i don't want to leave. (although i do have another job, and i'm looking for a better internship!)

i worked there for about two years and towards the end i was constantly on edge, irritated and in a bad mood even when i wasn't working. i couldn't get the place out of my mind. i even started to have nightmares about the place. my mood was always heavy and i just felt awful.

i understand that as apart of the lower class i am going to have to pay my dues. i also know that this position will not last forever, but i need money and this is the fastest way for me to get it. my question is now that i am about to re-enter this environment, how do i keep my emotions separate from the chaos? how do i not get sucked in by the negativity? how can i create a barrier around myself so that i am able to go to work, do my job and go home without still feeling connected to all the bullshit?

today, i had the first instance of a customer trying to order a strawberry lemonade. so far, i've only used the lemonade in refreshers and iced tea lemonades. i felt stupid because i had to tell her that i don't know how to make it, we don't have a recipe for it. i also had no idea how to charge for it, because our registers seem to be nothing like a typical starbucks register from what i hear. we don't have a button for lemonade, only for refreshers and iced tea lemonades.

i tried to offer her a strawberry acai refresher with lemonade, and told her what the price would be, and she said that she had gotten a strawberry lemonade from us before and it was a different price. i'm not sure who she ordered it from who would have improvised the drink, and i know that it wouldn't have tasted the same if i had also tried to improvise it.

ultimately, the customer got frustrated enough that she didn't order anything and left. i felt bad, but my options were to either make it up, or make the refresher correctly.

do you mix the lemonade with water? is it shaken or made directly in a cup? how do i know how much strawberry puree to use? we only have grande and venti for cold drinks. do you have a specific button for lemonade?

(little tickets that get target employees free drinks or pastries) i’m all for rewarding hard work (may i add we don’t get rewarded for anything not even a good job) but it’s gotten to the point where people get them because they are hungry or last saturday the front end team lead gave everyone working there one for just being there. this leads to everyone coming up during our busiest day getting large fraps and making it so we basically have longer lines and less time to restock. on top of that they come up and ask us to make them waters constantly during the day. i get people get thirsty but there are water jugs all over target and they don’t wait in line they come up to the bar and either ask or just stand there and expect us to stop what we are doing and automatically know they want a water made for them. it’s gotten to a point where they are asking for lemonade put in it or a free drink or free pastries. it makes me angry and when we are like “you were just up here” or “give me a minute i have to stock cause i’m by myself and you came right when the last customer of a rush left” they get attitude and say we are rude or mean. i don’t wanna seem mean but it makes my job harder by having to restock more frequently and stop in between customers to make these waters. i just want to find a way to make it so they don’t need to come up 8 times a shift and maybe think of us as coworkers instead of personal waiters.",what to do in this situation

i've been a partner since early march and am really struggling with how to handle this situation. 

i've become eligible to take a summer class that i really need to graduate with my bachelor's, but i have to move across the state a month earlier than i'd planned, which means i have to quit at my store.

the issue is that i only found out two days ago and would need to leave six days from now. i tried to talk about transferring with my manager a month or more ago, but she always put it off and now it's not really an option anymore. i'm our only mid and we've just lost a bunch of employees in the past few weeks. 

i would really like to work at a starbucks in the other city once i'm there, but is leaving on such short notice going to screw my chances by pissing off my manager? i feel awful having to leave my coworkers high and dry like this, but i really need to take this opportunity. is it even worth applying later in the fall?",quitting with less than two weeks notice?

5451,starbucks,"to begin with, i say none of this to instill fear but to bring awareness &amp; encourage you all to do your own further research &amp; come to your own conclusions.

i just today heard of the recalled chicken sandwich starbucks put on the menu but i believe there to be potentially pertinent information that is being overlooked or deliberately pushed aside. to my knowledge, starbucks has simply explained the recall as a “quality control” issue; this is rather ambiguous considering they were willing to provide clarity on the fact that it didn’t involve salmonella or listeria but they had no other info to provide. 

for a while now, for those that don’t know, a subtype-a influenza called h5n1 (colloquially called “bird flu”) has been spreading across the country &amp; other parts of the globe. [here is a link from a month ago that talks about h5n1](https://publichealthinsider.com/2022/05/25/alert-bird-flu-can-harm-backyard-poultry-and-wild-birds/amp/) in king county, washington where starbucks is headquartered. 

sine h5n1 first entered the u.s. there have been only either one or two human cases but the number of other animals getting it is honestly staggering; foxes, bobcats, a few other kinds of animals in the wild have either been found sick with h5n1 or dead from it. in the commercial realm of life, large-scale poultry companies that have any chickens that test positive for h5n1 [end up killing all the chickens like they did in colorado a few months ago.](https://www.peta.org/blog/22-million-birds-slaughtered-en-masse-amid-nationwide-bird-flu-outbreak/)

mind you, there are, to date, [37 states](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/data-map-commercial.html) dealing with an h5n1 outbreak right now; more than half of our nation is affected by this &amp; i point to this as potential causation for the recall - and a few others we will come to see in due time if this progress at the rate it has so far. i have no clue yet in my 45 minutes of googling where the hell they currently get their poultry ingredients from, so i reiterate: potentially, not positively fact. 

i’m going to be keeping an eye on this story, if it ever extrapolates. if anyone has any insight that makes this entire post moot, please do comment; i honestly am only providing this perspective as h5n1 isn’t as much of a talking point outside of local news stories that cover outbreaks &amp; the occasional article.

me: “your custom drink is generally espresso over ice, light ice as you asked, in a venti cup. these drinks don’t fill up all the way since it’s just a triple espresso over ice, with some milk/syrup.”
lady: “well i asked for extra oat milk so you can fill it all the way up.”
me: *pauses* “if i fill it all the way i have to charge you for either an iced latte or the standard drink with the same ingredients.”
lady: “are you f***ing kidding me?! we aren’t allowed to customize here?!?! the other starbucks let me do it and filled it.”
me: “first off, you are not going to swear at me. second, if the other starbucks did that, they did it wrong and not up to standard, im sorry.”
*lady continues yelling at me, swearing, getting in my face*
me: “if you are going to continue to yell and swear at me, you can leave. so do you want the custom drink or the iced brown sugar oat shaken espresso?”

she got onto me for putting ""too much ice"" in her paradise drink when all i was doing was filling it up to the trenta line.. we don't have trenta ice scoops so i have to do a venti scoop and a smaller scoop. she made me dump out the drink after yelling at me across the bar and remake it. she even put the ice in herself. then told me to make sure i shook it exactly 10 times. it makes me mad because she can't even ring orders up right on the pos. she had 3 months of training on dt before becoming an sm. we don't even have a dt.

what did it for me today was when i was trying to help out one of the older partners (mentioned above ab talking too much) because this girl's birthday reward wasn't showing up and it was because you have to have the app for a certain amount of time so that you can get it. and i tried to go over and help but she snapped at me to go back to cold bar and told me she had it when she didn't.. and then my sm had to help her and they were dealing with it for like 5 minutes. i almost cried. i teared up lmao. i was so done. 

and then i got barated for wanting to get a drink on my shift but apparently starbucks standard is one before your shift, one of your break, and one after your shift. i was never taught that. she only ever yells at me to stay planted. or whenever i'm moving positions. literally got onto me for cleaning cold bar because there was another person changing out the sani-buckets next to me. 

i literally went into work 35 hours last week and cover a shit ton of people's shifts because nobody wants to ever fucking work. i bust my ass because i can never get fucking scheduled and still i'm the only one that ever gets fucking yelled at. i'm tired of it. i feel like i'm not valued as a partner. my sm and a few others keep trying to get me to transfer to another store i work at periodically because i never get scheduled at mine. i'm tired of it because they think i'm a smart ass when really i'm just trying to help out.",im tired of coworkers treating me like an incompetent child

then, later as i was chilling on dtr another couple recognized me. same reaction “omg *insert name* hi!!” and their conversation was funny “do you ever get a day off? we see you here all the time” that was a funny comment. i don’t know, i love my regulars, i love my community.",recognition (good rant)

if you order your drink through drive through, i don’t care that you’re a regular and know what the price is, our drive thru routine ends with us telling you your total and repeating your order (or telling you to pull forward depending on if we’re at the screen) so you better wait until we tell you you can leave. so many times my experience is this:

me: “alright i have two iced caramel macchia-“ (headset proceeds to shut off because the car has already driven off in the middle of me speaking)

5608,starbucks,"so funny story. this happened like maybe a year ago

this couple comes through the drive through, theyve never been really been at starbucks much from what i can tell, since they order ""2 grande caramel macchiatos with a double shot for each"", aka the standard since the grande already comes with two.

however, me, the bozo on drive through, somehow miraculously mishears ""double"" as ""12"". i have a little difficulty hearing on the intercom sometimes evidently. perplexed, as anyone would be, i make sure to confirm with them - ""12 shots? did you say 12 shots?"" and they said yes. so i assume they also misheard me.

obviously im concerned for their wellbeing but i ring it through anyway, ive learnt by now to never question a customer, after all we've had someone come through and genuinely order a vanilla water with light milk before. anyway, my fellow baristas are also concerned, but make the drinks anyway since the customers said yes to my confirmation.

they get to the window, their order is like 30 dollars or some wild shit for 2 drinks. they still pay anyway and do not ask questions. as my colleague hands off the drinks, she confirms one last time, ""you wanted 12 shots right?"" and theyre just. confused. like ""no we didn't want 12 shots?"" but then, they say ""it's fine"" and take the drinks anyway. they did not ask for a remake? they literally drove off with the 12-shot caramel macchiatos. this is the most bewildering part of the story to me.

the other starbucks probably hasn’t been deep cleaned in months and might not be sanitary. they might not be dating their backup ingredients or food correctly either, they may not be giving their baristas/shifts proper or formal training especially on things that matter like sanitation/handling chemicals/etc. 

i thought of this anecdote bc there’s this other store in my district thats kind of infamous for not making drinks to standard and just giving customers whatever they want even if it is completely against the quality standards. and a lot of people in my city love that store bc the partners will just give them whatever they want even if it’s not remotely allowed; that store also has a mold problem and a fly problem, hasn’t had clean play scheduled in months, don’t make backups consistently, etc. 

to their credit they haven’t had consistent management in a long time which is the reason for a lot of this, so i don’t blame any of the baristas for this stuff bc i know a lot of it is out of their control and they haven’t been trained properly. but there are some stores i’ll never visit on my days off because i know too much and that store is one of them.","if you get told that the way “the other starbucks” makes your drink isn’t to standard, don’t get mad at the person who told you that, think about all the other things that store is probably doing wrong."

my first is when our “barista pick” drink ended up being a grande water with sweet cream foam for a week. i thought it was a joke until i just casually saw my coworkers drinking them? by choice? throughout the day? very divisive

and then the lemon cheesecake frap, involving cream cheese, lemon loaf, lemonade, vanilla, and heavy cream. i am a rabid defender of this one, however the lemonade and heavy cream mix absolutely destroyed my insides. tasty though :)

are cafés both price gouging nitro drinks and skimping on the gas itself leading to poor quality drinks? can any barista/coffee makers confirm or deny this?

5664,starbucks,"more starbucks locations are starting to ask for customer names in the drive thru in the name of ""customer connections."" customers and baristas alike know how ridiculous this is. is doesn't connect with customers, it just makes everyone frustrated

**if your store starts asking for your name in the drive thru, here is what you can do**

we as customers have more power to make change than baristas do. we can ask managers to stop asking for names in the drive thru, and we can call starbucks corporate to complain. if enough of us ask for change, they'll stop.

when we're asked this, it's important to remember that the baristas hate it as much as we do, and that baristas and other customers don't want want us to hold up the line. be kind to your baristas, and when you get asked for your name in drive thru, you can follow this script:

**barista: ""can i get a name for your order?""**

**customer: ""i'd like to decline to give my name. can you let your manager know that i hate being asked for my name in the drive thru?""**

you can also call starbucks customer service at 800-starbuc (800-782-7282) from 5am – 8pm pt, 7 days a week. when calling, you can use this script:

""hi, i'd like to make a complaint about a new process in the starbucks stores. i don't like being asked for my name in the drive thru. it does not make me feel connected to baristas as a customer; it just feels like a hassle. i would like to just place my order and continue with my day.""

(along with asking for a venti cup of ice for their no ice mango dragonfruit, which we don't do at our store but ok we can give them 2 water cups of ice)

i mean i suppose it technically is a loophole but what if we made the drink before they arrived? are they allowed to ask us to remake it with only 1 bag in when we followed the instructions that the sticker said? today we finally asked them what store they are from, and my asm sent an email to their sm just to confirm they do in fact work there.

5667,starbucks,"i was a former barista in the dtla area back between 2010-2017. i remember one (of the many) issue(s) that i had as a partner was people trying to cash out their giftcards. now not sure if it was just los angeles county or all of california, but there was a law that you could cash out your giftcard if it was $10 or less. cue people trying to do scams where they would take a stolen credit card, attach it to their mobile app and then buy a bunch of $10 starbucks giftcards, then later they would come back or have their ""friends"" come into the store and try to cash out all the $10 cards. it was a huge pain in the a\*\*. our drawers would get cleaned out if they had multiple giftcards or a bunch of these people came in at once.  management really couldn't do anything to stop it, but would they constantly get angry at us for cashing out these giftcards or telling us to not let people buy giftcards with giftcards. i think my store would limit how many cash outs we could do per person, but again that didn't stop these people from trying. obviously people would get angry and say that the law allows them to cash these out. i remember we spoke out about it to our dm (who was just useless at everything) and all she said was she didn't want to hear about it. it was basically a damned if we do damned if we don't situation. anyway the point i am trying to make is has there been any changes since then or are these scams still an issue? this might only apply to partners who work in the dtla area/california, but curious if other stores also have issues like this?",giftcard scams

after 2 weeks my sm finally texted me at 11:30pm to come in the next day at 5am for training. i should have just said no, but i was desperate at that point. best part - my manager wasn't even there when i got there and the sup made me do learning modules on his account because i didn't have a partner login or number yet. my sm took me off the schedule after that and told me i'll be trained somewhere else. it took her another 1.5 weeks to get me that schedule and when i showed up no one was aware that i was there for training. 


i haven't done any modules on my own account, i don't have an apron, i haven't done orientation yet or the first sip thing and know nothing about food safety but they threw me on pos, warming and order support all day by myself with only a few minutes of in person training. i got in trouble for not knowing how to sequence ringing up customers, warming and making drinks correctly during rush.

my dilemma is this: i’m not sure if i’m going to get in trouble for what i did. i called my dad, who works on a military base, to come pick up a lot of the food so he can share it with his coworkers. there are no homeless shelters in my city that i’m aware of either. i also called my aunt, who does not have much money, to come get what was left. 

i did not profit from this nor was there anything we could’ve done to keep the food cold enough for customers. partners have taken home boxes of food in the past with no trouble after because apparently this is a common issue here. i guess i’m just worried that even though i figure i was doing the right thing, i could get in trouble. and i really need my health insurance for school and transitioning.

5712,starbucks,"to try and keep this short essentially i’m getting written up for saying “libtard” (a word not even recognized by apple) in a joke making fun of the ways extreme conservatives try to insult liberals. the girl i was joking around with was the one who’s accusing i called her it but i didn’t. essentially how the conversation went was me saying something like “checkmate atheists” in reference to something i said then she laughed and said “haha yeah take that snowflakes” then i was like “yeah take that libtards” ( the brevity of the moment isn’t as clear through text but we were just kidding) after i said libtards she had reacted oddly and said she didn’t like the word i apologized and i thought that was it. she didn’t seem offended or mad at me. 

noted it was just me and her and a shift supervisor that constantly singles me out because i raise concerns for the things he has us do ( for instance making me do bathrooms and drive through at the same time even though they’re across the store and then getting mad at me for taking an hour to do bathrooms because i was at the drive through half the time) also he’s a new shift. 

my confusion is why i’m being written up because the girl didn’t seem mad at me the next day. she was still joking and talking to me. 

i also find it incredibly unprofessional that i haven’t been officially told i’m being written up the shift who does like me and the one that was there the day i said it was telling people other than shifts that i’m being written up. the only reason i know is because my friend told me he told him. 

the thing the errks me is that this is the first time i’ve ever said something that made someone mad or uncomfortable. i wasn’t even told not to say it or that it actually offended her so i could give an apology i’m just being written up without a warning or without any other kind of discussion with me. i want to apologize because i don’t want to hurt anyone i was just trying to make them laugh and the joke wasn’t at their expense.

i’m writing this because i need advice, it might be a little long but i think it’s important. if anyone reads this, i appreciate it. 

this morning in the midst of a rush i was informed by one of my shifts that someone was beating/hitting their child in our parking lot inside of their truck. i was immediately shocked (i have a personal history with child abuse and this comment hit home) but my shift said that we can’t do anything about it. this immediately brought up red flags in my brain and i say that if she sends me on a 10 or has someone swap me out for a bit (i was on drive through bar and the line was long so i couldn’t just walk off the floor, at least not without reprimand) i’d go call the police. she said it’s not an option because our store manager (who was also working at the time and in the store) would not let us call the police and in fact would get mad at us if we did. she then proceeded to tell me a story about how in the past one of my other shift supervisors called the police when he saw a man choking out his wife in his car and that our manager got mad at him. by the time she finished telling me this story the car had driven off and no one had done anything about what we had witnessed.

i’m shocked. i’ve been working this job for two years and i would never ever imagine nor was i ever told that we couldn’t call the police if we witnessed abuse or any other sort of crime. is my manager right? we’re not allowed to? this honestly makes me want to quit. 

is this something i should or could go to hr or ethics &amp; compliance about? because i find this just incorrigibly wrong. besides, in general, shouldn’t a situation like this go beyond our “responsibility” to the job? because i think it should—someone’s life is in danger. i mean, if someone’s bold enough to hit or choke someone in public imagine how bad it is in private. i feel guilty that i didn’t do anything about it. there’s a scared little kid out there that i could’ve helped and that breaks my heart.

5772,starbucks,"hey, barista here. i know sometimes it's funny for people to have drink orders with super long tickets and a ridiculous amount of syrups. this is not applicable to that. 
i've worked here for six months, and my go to drink when i want something sweet is an iced blonde quad with toffee nut, brown sugar, oatmilk, and sweet cream. as i've been ordering it, a couple of my coworkers have made comments about my order. they think it's weird i guess that i use oatmilk and sweet cream in the same drink? at first it was funny. after all this time, seeing as how this comment gets made like three times a fucking week, it's not. for context, i struggled with disordered eating and anorexia for almost six years. i've been in recovery for about a year, and i'm doing surprisingly well. now, i see some of my bad habits coming back when it comes to eating or drinking at work. if certain people are at the register, i won't order in fear of one last comment sending me into a breakdown. if certain people are working, i no longer feel comfortable eating or drinking in front of them. because of this, i find myself going full days without eating, or not being able to eat during an eight hour shift, coming home hungry and thirsty, and binging. please be careful of commenting to other's faces about their orders. you never know what someone's relationship to food is like.",please stop criticizing people's orders
5773,starbucks,"hi everyone, former partner here (2011-2016). i was (and still am) a major coffee geek. coffee master, barista championships, reserve coffees, the whole 9 yards. 

towards the very end of my tenure at starbucks, the company had started pulling back on the reserve stuff. the clovers were removed from the 2 stores in my district that had them, and we no longer carried reserve coffees. 

just yesterday though, i was delighted to discover that reserve coffees had made their way back to one of the stores. i bought a bag if png moanti, and i was surprised/disappointed to see how dark the beans were roasted. i don't remember any of the reserve coffees being so dark in the past.

my questions are: has this changed in recent years? or is the png moanti just particularly dark compared to other reserve coffees? are the reserve coffees still, generally speaking, lighter than the core coffees?",questions about reserve coffees (from a former partner)

i wanted to start by saying thank you to all the starbucks employees on this page! you are very appreciated :)

5777,starbucks,"so i always get the same drink. i never switch it up. 

iced-coffee, no classic, sugar-free vanilla, half &amp; half (instead of milk). 

so i know what it’s supposed to taste like. i can tell by the first sip whether it’s a good one or a bad one. 

lately, it’s been hit or miss and i have no idea why. 

the weird taste is hard to describe. i just know…it’s bad. kind of sour, but not overly so. sometimes it’s kind of…strawberry-y or banana-y (no, i don’t think it’s a case of cross contamination). again, it’s a hard taste to describe. 

i’m thinking that it could be the iced-coffee itself. 

i always have the store make the drink, but last month i was just buying the iced-coffee because i had the syrup &amp; cream at home (same exact brand of cream &amp; exact starbucks brand syrup). 

some days when i would “make this at home”, it would have that same weird taste. but not every time!

that’s why i’m thinking it’s the iced-coffee (as opposed to the cream or syrup being off). 

but why would the iced-coffee taste bad? if that’s even the case. 

again, it’s not every day, but once a week for sure i get a funky-tasting drink and it goes right down the sink. 

and i wouldn’t even know how to describe it to the baristas. “can you please re-make this? it tastes…wrong.” 

it’s always the same store/staff as well and i love them all so much! 

thank you for reading this far. 

have a great day!",what is this weird taste?

immediately she's yelling for my attention at the box just for her to tell me (rudely) to give her a minute to look at the menu. she then takes 3 mins to order each of her drinks. every time i ask her a clarifying question about how she wants her drink, she continues to make it more complicated and starts getting frustrated at me even though i want to make sure her order is correct. at this point she has about like 8 items that she's ordering and has been at the window for like 15 mins, and says ""you know what if i need to add anymore drinks i'll just tell you at the window,"" and then drives away before i can even read her whole order back to her. when she finally comes to the window, she continues to give me an attitude while i am trying to take her payment. at first, she shows me one of her gift cards that has 12 dollars on it and after i scan it, she says, ""wait a second! cancel that, i want to reload 35 onto my card,"" and hands me 40 dollars. i cancel the gift card payment so i can save the order and reload 35 onto her starbucks card that has no money on it. i was thinking to myself that it was kind of weird that she wanted to add money to a card that had no money on it since she'd still have to pay the remaining balance. and when i scanned the reloaded card, she still had a remaining balance and i told her that she still owes 9 dollars and some change. she then got mad at me because she had just reloaded her card and said it should have been enough because i scanned the 12 dollar gift card before hand. i had to remind her that she wanted to reload onto a different card and told me to cancel the gift card payment. if she had given me the correct card (the 12 dollar gift card) to scan in the first place and reload onto that card, there wouldn't be a remaining balance. (both cards were on her app). she didn't seem to want to listen but begrudgingly gave me her gc to scan for the remaining balance. i had switched off onto my break before she got her drinks and i am just glad i didn't have to keep dealing with her.",anyone have any difficult customer stories they want to share?
