2,starbucks,"now that the pumpkin sauce officially dropped what’s y’all opinion on it? 

someone said it tasted like veggies (like a veggie smoothie mix) and whoever said that i 100% agree with that. it definitely has a different taste compared to last year, i probably won’t get it again anytime soon. maybe my taste buds changed but i swear last year it was actually pretty good.",new formula pumpkin sauce thoughts?

6,starbucks,"okay so i’m obsessed with the apple crisp iced macchiato. problem is i despise oatmilk. i have a newborn so i always mobile order and his dad just goes and picks it up. i went into the app this morning and there’s zero option to be able to change the milk so i know i likely need to order a regular iced macchiato and add the syrup. question is what’s the best way to order it in the app? remove the vanilla and sub in the apple syrup? what is the standard on that? thank you!

7,starbucks,"this morning we received a delivery order including several pastries and egg bites. none of the food tickets specified “warmed.” in my experience with the starbucks app, you have to manually go and deselected “warm” to “not warmed” so i assumed maybe they didn’t want their items warmed. it’s not beyond ppl to want to warm their stuff later. there was no way to confirm with them because it was ordered through a 3rd party delivery service.

the person called and was super upset/chewing us out, i apologized and offered to refund if they come in but they weren’t satisfied with that. how would you guys handle this situation? i don’t really see how we are supposed to know, we’re not required to know how other apps work..",delivery order foods not warmed?
8,starbucks,"i'm a noob and literally never order from starbucks but i was just really in the mood for coffee today so i looked up good drinks and ordered this. when i went to go pick it up it though it was like halfway fucking empty lol. the barista at the window (bless her) was super sweet and asked if i wanted any milk in it and was nice enough to give me some. i wasn't thinking though and didn't ask but now i'm curious as to how i add milk to the drink over the app and make it like a normal drink...

how i built this: pump vanilla, pour water, tea bags and gave it a swirl then (like she asked for 😬) cold oatmilk directly into this tea that’s been in hot water for no more than a few seconds. 😵‍💫","hey besties, how would you make this order?"

20,starbucks,"hey guys...

just a quick question. i was browsing the shift marketplace for labor day week and i saw a lovely 7:15-2:15 shift available. without looking much into it, i claimed it! it's at another store, and it wasn't until after i claimed it that i realized that it is partial coverage and partial training. i'm not a trainer, so i can't train anyone, but i'm also definitely not a green bean, so i don't need training. so... this shift feels like something i can't do. who can i talk to in order to fix this?",accidentally acquired training shift
21,starbucks,we had a long store meeting today where we talked about concerns and stuff like that. i mentioned how we shouldn’t always say yes to customers because certain requests are against the standards and can make things harder for other partners and stores. our dm tells me to stop and just do what the customer asks me to because it’s “easier.” what do you think of this?,is this okay?
22,starbucks,"the way customers interact in the drive thru drives me nuts. i hate having to play 20 questions on dto. 
customer: i want strawberry açaí 
me: what size? 
customer: venti 
me: with water or lemonade? 
customer: make it with whatever it usually comes with
me: it can come with either one 
customer: lemonade then 

just a tip to customers. whenever you order always order with the size first and if it’s hot or iced. 
good example: i would like a venti iced caramel macchiato
bad example: i would like a caramel macchiato 

you can even say small, medium, or large, we know what you mean. do not say “regular size”. 

at the window, do not wait until i have handed you all of your items to ask for things. if we are waiting on something or even when i take your payment, ask then. this includes straws, napkins, cream, sugar, stoppers, sleeves, bag, cup of water. it’s a massive waste of time. 
 
baristas aren’t technically allowed to offer straws for drinks that do not require one as our cups are literally meant to be used without a straw. 

it’s very frustrating when i’m doing solo dt and a customer is waiting on their drink and waits for me to hand it to them to ask for a straw. i am already slower as i’m solo but it slows me down even more when people do that. on top of that, just ask for everything you want. don’t wait for me to come back with your cream to ask for another thing and then rinse repeat. 

a woman was at our window for literally 9 minutes doing this!",do not wait for me to hand you your drink to ask for a straw- grande rant
23,starbucks,"if you come to the front door and discover it to be locked, and after checking the hours, you realize the store is closed, there is a 99.99% chance that the side door will also be locked. the number of customers that walk around the side of our building to try and enter through the side door is mind-blowing.",a crazy idea
24,starbucks,"so. to start things out. my last shift, i took food home as the sm said it was okay. my huge fuckup here is that i think i put aside food like, 15 minutes before we actually closed, and a partner might've seen me do so (even though.. others were too and such.)

&amp;#x200b;

anyway. i was paranoid about it since then, because i know it's entirely on me and in general i shouldn't be taking food home, however i went to go check my schedule and while i swear it showed my schedule 2 weeks from now, it's saying the schedule has not yet been posted?? (like from the 12th onwards). i'm sick to my stomach and freaking out pretty bad. i haven't gotten any sort of notice from my manager, and my profile says it's still active, but could it be that i'm terminated and they put in my 2 weeks??",did.. i get fired/terminated? paranoid after doing something wrong + schedule app change

27,starbucks,"tomorrow is my last day and all of these are purely based off of my 2 years here. 

1. absorb as much as you can from your training and never be afraid to ask for help.

2. try out other brands of espresso, starbucks isn't that good tbh.

3. its not a bad thing if you're not always on bar. others need a turn and you might just aide your team better somewhere else.

4. we are a team. not everyone gets along but try to support your team as much as you can. it makes for an easier shift. 

5. be kind to your openers, odds are they have the highest traffic hours. this is a coffee shop.

6. your closers want to know what you need to open. they don't need to know every little thing that was wrong.

7. if you're opening, fully prep and stock everything you can think of. it can turn your whole shift around.

8. do not live and die for this job. it can be fun but its a job. your joints and bones are not worth the wear and tear. 

9. if you're a high schooler be respectful of your full time partners. this job is their livelihood and not always a fun place for you to chitchat and play around in. 

10. stores that gossip all the time are not worth the hassle.

11. grow a thick skin. the things customers say and do to us can be vile and rude. i promise holding on to any of it will hurt more than you need. 

12. find your regulars, these customers will be the best you have ever known and are more than worth the trouble of others. 

13. unionize. your managers are more often than not, not a good source of information about unions and cooperate does not care about us 

14. do not be afraid to speak up against your shifts to your manager if something wrong is happening. your concerns deserve to be heard

15. enjoy it. starbucks is a rush like no other. 

have fun everyone. it was nice knowing and making coffee with all of you. please try not to make any new osha violations. ♡",tips for new and incoming baristas
28,starbucks,so a local coffee spot near me went out of business so i supported them by buying some beans on clearance. unfortunately they are whole beans and they had already packed up their grinder by the time i picked them up and i don’t have a grinder at home. i do go into my local starbucks quite often to get drinks so just curious if you know or think that if i took my espresso beans in and asked for them to do a fine grind for me would that be possible?,free bean grinding?
29,starbucks,"i know they said they would be adding an update in late august. well it's late august!! i haven't been to work in two days and was wondering if they finally had updated it?! if anyone knows pls tell me, i cannot be left in suspense (even though i open tomorrow 😅)",dress code
30,starbucks,"in the middle of peak i'm dumbfounded by a reaction a customer of mine had. she ordered a venti caramel frappuccino with 6 shots. i pulled the shots directly into the cup, pumped 4 frap roast, and there was barely room for 1/4"" of whole milk. she saw me struggle with the whip and scrape it off once because the drink came over the top and i wasn't able to put the lid on (our whips were like frozen today and acting crazy) and there was a bit left in the blender but not much more than typical with some venti fraps. the excess got dumped as per usual. 

well she didn't like that, but first started out by asking ""is there 6 shots in this?""

""yes""

""and that's 6 more shots than like what the 2 or so already in it""

""no, typically this drink doesn't have any espresso, this was 6 total shots and 4 pumps frap roast""

""oh, well you did you throw away the rest usually there's more left""

""...yes""

she immediately gave me a glare and stomped off like i insulted her mother or something. what was left wouldn't have even filled a tall cup. but mini rant you pay for what fits in the cup, if there's extra in a blender or shaker that doesn't come on the side 😑",this cafe experience today
31,starbucks,"is it normal to double bar cold and hot for an entire shift? also there is no customer support so i was running to the back to restock by myself. no one was planted, it was chaotic. i didn’t feel proud of any of my drinks because i was running around trying to do so much at once. it was something i have never experienced at my old store (i miss it so much already and had to leave bc moving) i was a cafe only store before transferring…. sooo is this normal or… i was baring for mobiles/cafes … but again for all drinks.",i transferred to a new store from a super organized old store…

34,starbucks,"i was taking orders like normal when this guy pulls up to the speaker box, misses it and then reverses back through the drive through. he starts getting pissy at me when i tell him we have no caramel drizzle for a caramel frappichino. so he orders his long ass drink then starts to speed of before he throws it in reverse and comes back to the speaker box. he proceeds to go ""actually a tall"" so i asked him ""you wanted that in a tall instead of a venti? "" and he yells"" no! the same drink but in a tall!"" so making sure i wasn't getting anything wrong i ask ""you want two? one in a venti one in a tall?"" he screams yes and drives off too the window.

admittedly it was only two partners on the floor and we ran out of vsc for his vscc so  after i make the vsc i go to the window and tell him his total. he just looks at me with his phone and says nothing. i ask him ""apple pay? "" and he says yes so i hand the card reader out the window and he asks me ""do i insert my phone before or after?"" and confused say "" insert your phone? for what""  he responds like a smart ass "" for the points! what are you slow or something?""

at that point i close the window in his face and turned around to ask someone else to handle it. 

he also tried to apologize at my other barista but it was too late for that because he had time to apologize to me before i closed the window but he didnt 

it hurts even more because im not treated like a human at this job and im trying my best to be polite but i am on the spectrum and its hard and takes a lot of mental energy.

40,starbucks,"hey everyone! i transferred to a store in the town i am going to college in, and we recently unionized which is fantastic!

however, i am going to be taking a gap year and stay at home in a different city. i tried transferring the normal way, but i was told since i am going from a unionized to a non unionized store the transfer process looked different.

up until a month ago, i was scheduled regularly at the store in my home city. we had a change of store managers, and i was no longer on the schedule at all. only just today was i told that the store is not going to take me back onto the schedule, which is not fun.

i have a feeling it may be since i am coming from a unionized store, and i wanted to know what i’m supposed to do? i wasn’t fired, i’m still employed as a barista, but i don’t exactly have a store that i’m scheduled at right now.

49,starbucks,"dear starbucks and howie - you are slowly killing all things that starbucks was and all things they stood for.  do you know how many baristas cry on a daily basis at work?  probably not, they have to hide in the bathrooms/backrooms to make sure your ""third place"" is always intact.  do you know how many of your ""partners"" have anxiety attacks on a daily basis about work, having to come to work, or how they will afford to live?  probably not - most of them hide/mask this for fear of losing their jobs.  starbucks used to be a place that empowered their managers to go above and beyond for their partners - and now you have turned them into micro-managing robots ( of course there will always be exceptions) that have little to no outlets to spread joy to their partners.  

this is the reason i left - this is the reason you are losing great partners, this is the reason your partners want to unionize.  they do not feel like parnters.

you have stripped their will to pour their hearts unto their jobs, you have run them ragged by not providing enough coverage hours to do their jobs in a way that would make them and customers happy.

unfortunately you have made this only about money and power.  its truly sad.  i wish i could hug all the partners that put their heart into their work and never see a return.

50,starbucks,"the good ol' shaken espresso with no ice bullshit. we have a new regular who has been ordering this drink. venti shaken espresso, no ice, no classic, with almond milk. naturally when i arrived at this drink while bar supporting i told the baristas to let me know when this person showed up so i could explain that this drink isn't meant to be made this way. the baristas informed me that this regular is deaf and they have a hard time communicating with them so all of them have just been making a venti iced quad latte with no ice, essentially. 

today i got the mobile order again so i wrote on the cup ""this needs to be ordered as a latte, thanks."" i genuinely am not trying to be rude, i just want them to get what they want and understand that a shaken espresso is not what they are actually ordering. i'm not sure what will happen next or if they even noticed the note however i'm not going to give someone special treatment just because they are deaf/hard of hearing. actually i find it quite rude when someone acts entitled because of a disability. i try extremely hard to treat everyone the same, equally, no matter who they are or how i feel about them (if i know them well). everyone deserves to be treated fairly. i feel as though it is not fair to give this one person a pass just because they aren't willing to try and communicate with us.

that being said, i'm not sure if anyone has ever actually explained to them that this drink cannot be shaken and *is,* in fact, an iced latte. i guess we'll see. i have not checked the price difference on a venti shaken espresso vs a venti iced quad latte. i don't know what the correct way to go about this is, i'm just hoping maybe next time i can actually talk with her somehow to help clarify what these drinks are so that she can order exactly what she wants.

what would you do in this situation? am i wrong for writing a note on her drink? was i rude and/or inconsiderate? i truly don't mean to be however i've been second guessing my decision to write on her cup and i think i could have worded a little better. i'm open to suggestions and constructive criticism. give it to me.",shaken espresso with no ice struggle

of course there are exceptions to this, such as children, people with social anxiety, those who are hard of hearing, etc. but i am comfortable getting down on a child’s level to hear or signing, and there’s no excuse for the average regular to not know how to properly order a venti cup of coffee.

59,starbucks,"i applied for a shift manager for a long time ago 2 out of 5 partners have gotten the interview but have not gotten promoted yet. ever since i applied i started to get attacked by my manager carley houser out of nowhere as if she was trying to find ways to fire me. my 1st warning is understandable i take full responsibility but the 2nd to the separation letter is not sitting well with me. i was told that on august 9 i would get an interview but then my manager was nowhere to be found which is understandable i’ll wait till monday the 8th when i get my 2nd write-up out of the blue moon but it was small lateness not big numbers and it was my final notice for the last two weeks i felt uncomfortable working there. recently on august 1st during that time we had a shift that quit so we had no closing shift and have been closing the store early cause there was no outside shift that didn't wanna help or close on their day off. on august 22 i came in expecting there to be a closing shift it was enough time to find coverage. i thought wrong i came in at 2 pm hearing that the store was closing in 3 hours i was there in shock so my mind was to do support and do the close at the same time while hearing the morning shift she wants to leave she doesn't deserve this we have to leave 5 on the dot while i was stressing about the trash if my partners are okay then we kept getting false information that a shift from bayonne was coming never came by the way. the store was closed at 5 and left at 5:30 then i heard mumbling from the morning shift wny and edge water i didn't put my mind to it cause i clocked out i was scheduled 2-8 wanted to go home.then my manager started to text me if i went to edge water an hour later i scratch my head i told her i left and was on the highway that was an hour away from starbucks and tells me to turn around and come back. the following day she asked me what happened i told her she said well i don’t know what kevin the district manager thinks about this situation and said clock in and see if your numbers work which shocked me which felt like a threat. two days pass by i was worried and then the day came i get the letter it didn't affect me on the spot but these past two days have been taunting me every partner thinks that the separation was wrong it bothers me a lot because there are partners that came at the manager call out constantly who always come late but never get talked with or written up and the night crew is thinking she's coming at the night care only. i've called kevin (dm)and left a voicemail to talk about my separation but nothing

61,starbucks,"if you read the dress code update in this weekly update: we are now allowed to wear *any* color shirt, and wear “comfy” clothes like jeggings. 

however, keep reading and you will see it says, roughly, “this does not apply to unionized stores. by federal law, we must negotiate *everything* with the union first.”

for one, it was just determined federally to be illegal to not give unionized stores the $15 minimum raise. now they’re insinuating that unionized stores cannot have *more lax* policies implemented.

this is a really obvious attempt to make unionizing look bad to us. “wow, union stores don’t get all the good things the company wants to give us!” very desperate tactic to dissuade unionization.

think about it. this was the company with the 80 page “lookbook”, the rigid dress code that cannot clash with the green apron. now i can stroll into my job wearing neon green. that is so out of character for this company. so much so, i thought there must be some misunderstanding.

64,starbucks,"the idiot customer in question is me!

recent post about sugar addiction made me look up the sugar for my favorite drink-venti chai frappucino and while i get it with soy and no whip, i would bet that it's still pretty close to the 57 g of sugar posted for the standard recipe. i then looked up the iced chai latter and it's even more sugar at 61g for the venti. i get the chai frap 3-4x/wk fyi

can someone explain how that works? someone else kindly answered in another post that sugar is pre-added to the chai mix which explains a lot. is there another syrup added or is the ""chai mix"" just chai and sugar?

any suggestions on less sugary drinks i would like based on my taste preferences?

i like chai, cinnamon, caramel, mocha, espresso (?), cold drinks preferred

can't do nut milks

i'm def going to spend an afternoon playing around with diff recipes online to make a dupe of the chai frap with less sugar. just waiting on a delivery of xanthum gum...

65,starbucks,"i work mornings at 4am and constantly i'm placed in the drive-through, doing both dto and dtr. i liked it in the beginning, but the morning shifts put me there all the time and it's burnt me out too many times--no one at my store likes the drive-through and it's only green beans who are placed there. 

i was placed on dto/dtr today and noticed that the times were unusually high--i checked and saw that i was waiting on a few food items for the car at the window. everyone was occupied and i asked a few times on headset if the food was ready, but i didn't get a response. so i left my area at the drive-thru and walked to warming, which one of my coworkers who is a shift supervisor (but wasn't the ""keyholder"" at the time, if that makes sense) immediately yelled at me in front of my other coworkers, saying ""can't you just wait at your position. do you know you're not supposed to leave? you're really stressing me out"", and immediately i apologized because it wasn't my intention. 

i don't know but i feel humiliated in some way. previously there were multiple times where her coaching seemed a bit pretentious. she'd start her comments with ""can you please \[...\]"" or ""you're supposed to know this/that"". i accepted it in the beginning because i was a new barista, but i just can't do this anymore :/ i also don't really know if this is because of starbucks policy or something, but none of the shifts at my store ever work at the drive-thru, they're either on front or customer support. 

i'm always placed at the drive-thru. i'm really starting to despise it, i've asked if i can be switched, and my morning shifts say that it's my only option--that i can do dtr/dto, or both. i'd work in the afternoon since the closing shifts are way more laidback, but i can't because of school. i'm really thinking about putting in my two weeks because honestly this is my last straw ://",a venti rant about a condescending shift supervisor

67,starbucks,"(this can apply to the main starbucks or any of the starbucks in stores ie. bullseye, kiosks in malls, etc)

so i used to work at the starbucks in bullseye and i moved out from it. while i was there, there were no rules against any kind against makeup or hair colour. you could wear lipstick, eyeliner, you could have funky hair, etc.

one of my friends just started working there with their partner, and they just dyed their hair pink and were told it's not allowed for sbux employees and they had to dye it a natural colour. their partner also told me that they weren't allowed to wear any kind of makeup except eyeliner, no lipstick or anything.

is this a new thing, or is this just the bullseye management giving them false info? because they weren't told by the manager for the sbux, they were told by a manager of bullseye.

i feel like saying ""no lipstick"" is really a tad too far for limits on presentation. nail polish? sure. it chips. hair colour? weird, because i don't think anyone's sweating hard enough for the dye to drip into food. lipstick? how is that a food safety hazard?? even if they're all masked (which isn't required for them anymore but they still mask up) they still can't wear it. it baffles me.",question for people who work at starbucks
68,starbucks,"i never never been able to successfully order an iced mocha at the starbucks near my house, which is really the only drink i like. whether i order it by itself or with a few other items (like also picking up a drink for my sister on the way to see her) they make an iced white mocha. 100% of the time. i’ve even ordered it as “an iced mocha, not an iced white mocha, please” and it still gets made as a white one. 

i always ask them to remake it. it’s annoying because it’s such a weird thing, but i’m never rude and they usually do it. but only usually. the last three times i’ve gone when i asked for a regular mocha they’ve said no, this is the correct drink. and wouldn’t remake it. it’s so weird because i only get starbucks once a week max and they were three separate baristas. i said my drink should be brown not white, and they said “they just sometimes look like that.”

but their gaslight gatekeep girlboss strategy is working because i always just take it and give it to my sister or a friend. i’ve never had a starbucks not only always get the drink wrong, but refuse to remake it. is it just my store? am i the problem? it’s a $7 once-a-week splurge i’m having to drive to another starbs 20 mins away to get because the vibes of my local one are so weird.",local baristas keep gaslighting me over my drink?

80,starbucks,"hi yall i was curious if there's such a thing as a shift trainer. like barista trainer but for shift supervisors. i was trained for my position by my store manager and we haven't hired a brand new shift since i've been there. we've just had people transfer in who had some prior experience as a shift. so i was just wondering if only store managers can train baristas to become shifts, or if it's possible for a shift supervisor to train people to become shift supervisors? i ask because we just had this new shift transfer in and he only had a little experience as a shift, but did all his training already, but my manager had me run a bunch of shifts with him to train him. but it was just me like free wheeling it based on how i know to do the job. it wasn't like i was using modules or anything. and like i said he had done the training so he knew like how cash management and stuff worked, but i was more explaining like when to do what things and like the flow of the store.  


anyways, i really loved training him and i realized i miss training newbies. i've trained like 7 green beans and i almost always love the experience i have with them. 2 of my trainees have become shift supervisors and pretty quickly too. and i'm super proud of both of them. one of them was a gifted almighty natural and took to everything so quick. the other struggled and i coached her and continued to coach her and she got better and better and better. and she always told me what a great teacher i was. she is such a ray of light and i know some of her past and getting that promotion i know meant a lot to her. also, i have to say i love being on more of my own schedule when i'm training. it feels nice to have more control of your time at work.  
anyways now that i'm a shift i know its super rare to have me train new hires. and honestly, the experience i had training a shift this week was really great. i would love to train more people becoming shift supervisors. like i'm thinking the same way the barista trainer system works where we follow along a training plan and the modules and shit. but all i know of is my own experience where my store manager trained me.",are there shift trainers or is that just a store manager thing?
81,starbucks,"today we were understaffed because someone called out sick, so our close was already going to be a bit more difficult then usually but no big deal. turns out that shit is a big deal, our opening staff have been rude and pushy with how we’ve been closing (it’s been taking us 45 minutes to close the store since we are so low stock on everything and such a busy store so we make a mess) saying that we forgot to clean the vanilla syrup pump and bs like that. was working a 4.45 hour today, close ran extra long since we were short someone so my shift gave me the option of either going home and leaving him alone in the store or working through my lunch. either one was very much not ideal but i know he would never put me in this position on purpose, he truly felt bad about it. i didn’t want to leave him completely alone so i said sure and worked through my unpaid lunch. 90 minutes. it took us 90 minutes to close and it was a bad close at that. manager needs to not schedule closers for 4.45 hour shifts cause if it takes an extra 15 minutes it fucks over everyone!!! anyways just wanted to rant because this was so frustrating 0/10 would recommend but at least my shift is super nice and tried to make it a good experience :)",why do these things always happen to me.

i interviewed for starbucks and during my interview i was asked if i would be willing to be at other stores in the same city. i said yes because there was no particular reason for me to only work at that specific store. so turns out they were sending me to train at a store as a new one was opening up. at the store i was training at, i made such good friendships with the partners there in a matter of a few days. they’re all very good at working together and very good with each other aside from work as well. sadly i had to leave them as soon as the new store opened and i hoped it was for the best. unfortunately, they turned out to no be very nice people. they’re not very good at communicating for work and teamworking. they spend the time they have in between peaks talking instead of stocking things, cleaning up, chechick ice, etc. (which they could honestly do while talking since they’re using headsets anyways) but honestly i think this mostly bothers me because they usually leave me out and when i do try to talk and start conversations i’m shut out. i’ve never had a bad interaction with them or anything, but they’ve just known each other before and maybe that’s why. that’s why transferring back came up, but idk what to tell my manager cuz i cant just tell her they don’t include me lol (and if i do they’d prolly deny it either way) but yeah idk what to tell her. in addition to all that i've inly been at the new store for a few weeks. would i need to be there for a certain amount of time before transferring or no. also, the store i wanna transfer to is further from the one im at now, so i cant use commute as an excuse. plz lmk your guys opinions on what i should do. im honestly so confused😭",vent rant :))

104,starbucks,"former partner here. i was employed in 2016, promoted in late 2018 until i was separated as a ssv in 2020 without probable cause (hr is no help), returned in 2021 as a barista thinking i could start all over and quit the same year because i realized this life is behind me now. i put off my education because i was so invested in moving up the latter. i only hung out with coworkers and i constantly thought and spoke about starbucks in social settings. my friends that didn’t work for the company found it very annoying.

one year later, i am a different person. i have a 4.0 gpa in college, employed at a local coffee shop making more tips and better hours, and more importantly, my relationship with my close friends that never worked for the bux improved immensely. there are times where i do miss working for the company and the few good customers that made it a positive experience, but i remind myself of how horrible of a time it was while working there. 

my current job, we are required to sign an nda to prevent any sort of workplace hostility such as gossiping about coworkers. i cannot tell you how fantastic it is that i work with people that do not form cliques, talk about each other, and support each other regardless of their skill set on the job. we know we signed a contract and we can get fired if we spoke badly about one another, but it subconsciously influenced us to see the good in each other instead of finding a trait that bothers us towards each other. having a positive work environment without any animosity truly does improve your well-being and mentality overall.

to all the baristas out there, you are all doing a great job. i understand that most people who move up do not deserve to be in the positions they’re in, but try to overcome it and prevent engaging in any sort of negative interactions with other baristas, ssvs, sms and even dms. we all hate the cliques, gossiping, the unsupportive behavior, nepotism, favoritism and horrible customers, but remember you are wonderful as a person. don’t let starbucks consume you and make it your personality, it will hold you back and possibly fall into a depression like i did. go in, do your job, and go home. north star? third place? customer connection? do the bare minimum. the company can care less about you and replace you in an instant, so as i said, don’t let it become you. if you need the job, then stay. if you want to move up, that is also good too, just remember who you are deep down inside. life outside of starbucks is great. i am a lot happier leaving behind the toxicity that was prevalent within the company. you don’t have to be like me and leave to be happy, but i’m just sharing my experience. if you have great partners, a store manager, and district manager, consider yourself lucky because i see that as a rare occurance, cherish it. nevertheless, do what makes you happy regardless.

111,starbucks,"my girlfriend loves starbucks, they go there every other day but recently they’ve been saying that they want to try something new since they get the same drink every time. (mocha frappuccino)

the thing is, i never go to starbucks unless it’s with them. i don’t really know any drink other than the mocha frappuccino. another thing is that i drink my coffee black, the complete opposite of them, which means that the drinks i find too sweet for me are not sweet enough for them. so, every time i try to order a new drink for them to try, they don’t like it that much

they like drinks that are reeally sweet and don’t taste too strongly like coffee. they also like caramel and chocolate. and cold drinks, even in winter time. i really want to find something they would like, so what are your favourite sweet drinks? whether it’s on the menu or it’s your own concoction of syrups, i’m not stopping until i find a drink they like",what is your favourite sweet drink?
112,starbucks,we are going to lose our strongest long-term  partners b/c they are not getting hours    our shop needs a serious clean   and through call outs and crappy schedules- nothing is ever done thoroughly.      but hey ….. thanks for the 75¢,stupidity

116,starbucks,"my first time as a barista during the fall, &amp; i like these flavors but don’t know what to mix them in. so far i like the vanilla cold brew w/ pumpkin foam. what’s the closest-tasting recipe for caramel apple or apple pie?",what are good drink combos using apple brown sugar syrup or pumpkin syrup?
117,starbucks,"my usual order is an upsidedown cm with whip cream and extra drizzle .  someone suggested it would be the same drink, but cheaper if i ordered a vanilla latte with the same extras.  can someone tell me if this is correct?",carmel macchiato or vanilla latte
118,starbucks,i've been a partner for about two months now. i have a few friends who work at different stores and both of them have timers that go off every 30 minutes or something as a hamdwashing timer? our store doesn't have that 🤷‍♂️ dunno if that's a standard thing or not,apparently other stores have a 30min handwashing timer??
119,starbucks,"i was on drive through window like four days ago and i haven’t stopped thinking about this one customer. it’s been making me so upset. as soon as she pulled up to the window i greeted her and then she immediately recommended me a topical skincare product (like not mlm or anything cause then she would have given me a card). she just said “do you like organic stuff?” im like “yeah i guess haha” and then she’s like “there’s this all natural organic skin cream called ___ that could help with your acne” and im like “oh it’s hormonal so topical stuff doesn’t work” and she was like “no this one does work cause it doesn’t have all those chemicals like the one you’re probably using” and i had to smile through the whole thing cause we *have* to be nice to people. i was just starting to feel better about my skin cause it’s not as bad as it usually is around this time of month and i’m still so upset about that one interaction.

i guess tl;dr- just because your barista is being kind and acting happy it doesn’t mean they are and please be considerate of the fact that we have feelings.",reminder to be kind to your baristas
120,starbucks,"i had a lady come in &amp; here’s how our interaction went. 
me: hi welcome in! what can i get for you?? 
her: okay i have a kind of specific order, can i just get a medium cup of almond milk with ice and a shot in it? 
me: okay! so that was just a medium cup of almond milk with a shot in it and ice? 
her: yes! a medium cup of almond milk with ice and just one shot! 
me: okay! so like a medium iced almond milk latte but with just one shot? 
her: no one’s ever called it that before but i guess... i just want cold almond milk with one shot in it! 
me: okay! sounds good!! 

forty minutes later, she comes back in &amp; talks to my coworker:

her: hi! this drink was made wrong. it has coffee in it! 
coworker: oh okay, can i look at the ticket? *looks at ticket* hmm okay so this would have coffee in it. do you mind repeating what you wanted? 
her: just a cold almond milk with one shot in it! 
coworker: okay so that is what you got...
her: no! i wanted cold almond milk with just a shot in it, that is not what i got! 
coworker: okay... so you wanted-
her: i just wanted cold almond milk with one shot of chai in it!!!!! 
coworker: chai? umm okay so you wanted an iced almond milk latte with just one shot and with chai? let me remake that for you! 
her: no! i just want one shot of chai! 
coworker: yes, so an iced latte with just one shot and with chai! 
her: no!! no coffee!! just a shot of chai!! 
coworker: *finally gets what she means* oh! okay let me make that for you! 
her: and throw this out!!!! 
coworker: i actually cannot that for you but there’s a trash behind you! 
then she was flabbergasted that we weren’t allowed to throw out her drink for her &amp; that she had to walk a few steps to the trash can!!!

this was just insane. she never once said chai when ordering with me. like girl just order and iced chai latte with almond milk and with just one pump of chai😭 also the syrups &amp; sauces are pumps, shots are only referring to coffee, and using the wrong language is frankly confusing. please learn how to order the drink you want if you’re gonna be so specific about it!","shots are coffee, pumps are syrup: a trenta rant"
121,starbucks,"i hate when customers stand right behind me while i get their food ready (this usually happens during peak) so i pretend i don’t see them and call out the food in the other side where the pick up is and leave it on the counter. worst part is when they comment on it like “i didn’t want that warmed up” and it’s not even their order 💀 sir i have five bacon goudas and three different pumpkin loafs, be patient",short rant

they leave milks out, pitchers out, don’t wash the shakers or steamers until a new order requires it. the counter is a disgusting sticky mess and i’ve had guests complain to me about their drinks and how they’re always sticky outside.

145,starbucks,"it was on purpose but my coworker told me to try a sip so i did. i genuinely gagged. i almost threw up it was so bad. like the worst thing i’ve ever tasted. i put three (gorgeous perfectly round) coffee pucks in a short cup,  some 2% and caramel drizzle. i mashed it up a bit and one of my ssv took a giant sip of it. i made a joke about trying it and my coworker told me to and mama ain’t raise no b*tch. i took a tiny sip and it was the most vile, disgusting, putrid thing i’ve ever had. my stomach turns even thinking of it. the pieces of the espresso pucks and the warmness of it was so horrible. 10/10 would recommend to try tho. humbling to know that i can make something so bad 😙🤞",i made the nastiest drink today
146,starbucks,"i have gotten the iced shaken   oat milk brown sugar espresso and iced chai latte in size grande, also venti. it’s my personal opinion that the grande tastes better than the venti. the grade has more flavor and tastes stronger ( i can taste the chai and the brown sugar / cinnamon) . it just tastes better. the ventis tastes more watery.. in these drinks. 
is there any reason why?",why does a grande taste better than a venti?
147,starbucks,"i'm still fairly new. i've only worked part time for about a month now. i feel like i haven't been fully utilizing my markouts. i want to get as much as i can because i feel like i'm leaving money, or food, on the table. and that only goes back to benefit a big corporation. anyway, i usually come in 15 min before my shift and get a free coffee. after working, i usually get a free sandwich and iced tea. so, that's two free drinks and one food markout. i know they say we get three free drinks per shift. is that other free drink only accessible during my shift/on my break? can i get my free coffee before my shift and then two free drinks when i leave? 

okay, then food markouts. we get seven food markouts a week. i usually only work four days a week. i've worked three days this week and go in tomorrow, sunday. like i said i usually only get a sandwich or other food item everytime i work. that's three food markouts i've used this week. i should have four left. does that mean tomorrow i can go home with four free food items? and how do i do that? i've bought more than one food item before and when i select ""partner food"", it only applies it to one item then charges me discount price for the other items. on the pos, do i have select each item in the order and apply partner food? or do i have to do separate transactions for each item and apply partner food on each transaction? 

last question (i know i've gone on long)... food markouts on days we're not working. my sm briefly explained it to me when i was hired but i didn't understand fully how it worked. i think she said we can only mark out food on days we work. if we plan to come in on our day off, we could mark out a food for that day. how does that work? for example, i know i will want a blueberry muffin on my day off. do i just mark out a blueberry muffin then come in on my day off and tell the barista working i already marked out a muffin? is there something else i'm missing? how do they know we marked it out? do they check? i can see how that could possibly be abused.",question on food/drink markouts

159,starbucks,"i’m positive that this has already been talked about at some point but i really just need to vent right now. 

i was on register and a customer came up to me “do you guys have the marble frappuccino?” i told them no; that it is not on our menu, but if she has a recipe that we can follow, i’ll be happy to send it along to the barista on bar. she proceeded to pull out her phone and show me a tiktok. the video didn’t even have the written recipe, i just literally had to watch the guy make the drink. if i’m remembering correctly, it ended up being a caramel ribbon crunch with cookie crumble, caramel drizzle, mocha drizzle, and whip cream on the top and bottom. i was so beyond annoyed that i had to stand there and watch the video, when the customer could have had the recipe ready to go to read out loud or hand to me to read.

no other restaurant or food place has customers doing stuff like this. 
like imagine going to a restaurant and ordering by showing a tiktok video of a guy making steak and mashed potatoes a specific way. i just can’t with the entitlement. i am completely okay with “out there” orders or complex builds, or whatever. but have the decency to come with the recipe ready to go. she should have sat down, watched the video herself, and wrote down the order for us. 

i remained pleasant and she got her drink made exactly how she wanted it, but this was the first time i’ve had to deal with this. i think in the future, i’ll tell the customer to write it down and then come back to the register. baristas, how do you handle situations like these?",ordering using tiktok videos 🙄

161,starbucks,"can anyone give me an honest second opinion on how i’m doing, how bad my mistakes are, and what to do with this one supervisor who has a lot of issues with me? i’m afraid i’m in a lot of trouble, and i honestly don’t know what to do at this point. 

i’ve been working at starbucks for about a month and 2 weeks, including training. i’m still struggling a lot. it’s a combination of things that are making me feel behind, but if i had to simplify it then i’d say it’s a mix of subpar training and my natural tendency to be bad at details. 

i trained at a different store because there were a lot of new hires. a lot of the training was online. i was able to practice a bit of cs and p.o.s. and i only got about 2 days on bar. there were a lot of things i was only told or shown once very quickly with little to no practice that i had a hard time remembering. 

i was lucky enough to get retrained for 3 more days after a few weeks of a lot of mistakes, and i feel a lot better with the job. the only issue is that now everyone knows me as an anxious mess so i’m not well respected. some people are nice but others don’t give me the benefit of the doubt anymore. i feel more secure in my knowledge of the job now because i had a chance to ask all my questions, and get told all the rules and terms i didn’t even know existed up until that point. but i’m still working on speed and accuracy. i generally am bad with nit picky details. so even when i know what to do i mess up a lot, particularly on pos. (eg. accidentally charging for milk when you shouldn’t, accidentally scanning rtdne items twice)

so, one of my shifts is really fed up with me. she’s new to the store and is a very detail oriented person. knows how to do her job fairly well since she’s been at it for so long but in my opinion has difficulty with in the moment improvisation, which i feel is equally important. i feel like much of the time things inevitably can go wrong or slower than expected but she typically struggles to adapt to it and gets visibly frustrated. in moments like this she struggles with multitasking and lacks the ability to give clear instructions while she’s doing other things. most people don’t get in any trouble for it because they already know how to do their jobs even without her instruction and have a reputation for being good at what they do already. 

she’s definitely more by the book than my other shifts. she always picks up on the little details i miss and gets really upset with me. sometimes she feels guilty and starts being nice out of nowhere, but ultimately always falls back on getting openly fed up with me for something or another. even off the floor she thinks i’m incompetent and doesn’t trust that i have any common sense. she doubts most things that i say even while we’re having small talk. and hasn’t asked me for permission before keeping me late twice now. whenever something is off i’m the first person she blames for it. i get that sometimes i get anxious and have trouble doing the job completely correctly but she doesn’t respect me as a person. she’s open to other people about how much i hold her back and i feel like if i can’t do my job perfectly in the next few days she’s going to try to get me fired. she openly can’t stand me and looks exasperated just being around me. she’s right to be upset, there are a lot of things she’s had to tell me to do multiple times that i blatantly can’t remember or get right. but i feel completely and utterly disrespected by her in general and i think she truly has a problem with me. 

that said, do shifts have a lot of authority over who gets let go or at least in a lot of trouble? 

if you asked my other coworkers or shifts then they probably wouldn’t think i’m very competent either. but when my other shifts notice me make mistakes they are way more forgiving or able to improvise with it as it happens even if they are frustrated for a second. 

so yeah i keep making small detail oriented mistakes. more examples would be queueing shots before milk.. fumbling with cash.. being slow on cs.. asking if they want sweetener for the wrong drinks… not putting names on every order… 

i understand that my mistakes slow down the rest of the floor and i feel truly remorseful for it. but i feel like no matter how much i try to write down and retain, my inability to be detail oriented always comes around. i can’t stop messing up. and if i don’t get better soon, this lady’s issue with me could get serious. i don’t know what to do.",can this one supervisor who has a serious problem with me get me fired?
162,starbucks,"for reference, we do sell decaf iced coffee in my region.

her: light heavy cream.

me: anything else? ^no *total*

then she gets to the window and the bar partner has by mistake made it hot. *remade* then she said is tastes wrong. but won't clarify what tastes wrong about it. then finally the dtr figures out that she's is mad that the heavy cream is mixed in. so we remake is and carefully all pass it to the dtr partner trying not to wiggle it at all so the heavy milk doesn't follow the laws of gravity and mix in. 

she was in our dt for just shy or 13 minutes this morning during our saturday peak. bro. what? i am a very composed partner, but damn. lady had me questioning if i know how words worked anymore. i clearly used the word ""decaf"" 800 times. the dto screen clearly listed a decaf iced americano. what is happening!!!??? excuse me while i bang my head into the counter to make it end. 

bonus story: had someone idle as the dt window for 12 minutes this morning before we opened. car behind him, also waiting for the window, instead of... a parking spot? or even the order box? was there, idling 9 minutes to open, and then one more car at the speaker box 2 minutes to open.

163,starbucks,"can anyone give me an honest second opinion on how i’m doing, how bad my mistakes are, and what to do with this one supervisor who has a lot of issues with me? i’m afraid i’m in a lot of trouble, and i honestly don’t know what to do at this point. 

i’ve been working at starbucks for about a month and 2 weeks, including training. i’m still struggling a lot. it’s a combination of things that are making me feel behind, but if i had to simplify it then i’d say it’s a mix of subpar training and my natural tendency to be bad at details. 

i trained at a different store because there were a lot of new hires. a lot of the training was online. i was able to practice a bit of cs and p.o.s. but i only got about 2 days on bar. there were a lot of things i was only told or shown once very quickly with little to no practice that i had a hard time remembering. 

i was lucky enough to get retrained for 3 more days after a few weeks of a lot of mistakes, and i feel a lot better with the job. the only issue is that now everyone knows me as an anxious mess so i’m not well respected. some people are nice but others don’t give me the benefit of the doubt anymore. i feel more secure in my knowledge of the job now because i had a chance to ask all my questions, and get told all the rules and terms i didn’t even know existed up until that point. but i’m still working on speed and accuracy. 

i generally am bad with nit picky details. so even when i know what to do i mess up a lot, particularly on pos. (eg. accidentally charging for milk when you shouldn’t, accidentally scanning rtdne items twice while people are paying)







so, one of my shifts is really fed up with me. she’s new to the store and is a very detail oriented person. knows how to do her job fairly well since she’s been at it for so long but in my opinion has difficulty with in the moment improvisation, which i feel is equally important. i feel like much of the time things inevitably can go wrong or slower than expected but she typically struggles to adapt to it and gets visibly way too frustrated. in moments like these she struggles with multitasking and lacks the ability to give clear instructions while doing other things. most people don’t get in any trouble for it because they already know how to do their jobs even without her instruction, and have a reputation for being good at what they do already. 

she’s definitely more by the book than my other shifts. she always picks up on the little details i miss and gets really upset with me. sometimes she feels guilty and starts being nice out of nowhere, but ultimately always falls back on getting openly fed up with me for something or another. even off the floor she thinks i’m incompetent and doesn’t trust that i have any common sense. she doubts most things that i say even while we’re having small talk. and hasn’t asked me for permission before keeping me late twice now. whenever something is off i’m the first person she blames for it. i get that sometimes i get anxious and have trouble doing the job completely correctly but she doesn’t respect me as a person. she’s open to other people about how much i hold her back and i feel like if i can’t do my job perfectly in the next few days she’s going to try to get me fired. she openly can’t stand me and looks exasperated just being around me. she’s right to be upset, there are a lot of things she’s had to tell me to do multiple times that i blatantly can’t remember or get right. but i feel completely and utterly disrespected by her in general and i think she truly has a problem with me. 

that said, do shifts have a lot of authority over who gets let go or at least in a lot of trouble? 

if you asked my other coworkers or shifts then they probably wouldn’t think i’m very competent either. but when my other shifts notice me make mistakes they are way more forgiving or able to improvise with it as it happens even if they are frustrated for a second.

so yeah i keep making detail oriented mistakes in particular. more examples would be queueing shots before milk.. fumbling with cash.. being slow on cs.. asking if they want sweetener for the wrong drinks… not putting names on every order… things are always a bit less smooth when i’m on the floor. more people are waiting, we fall more behind… 

no matter what i do i always miss something. i understand that my mistakes affect everyone on the floor and i truly feel remorseful for it. i’ve been taking notes and trying my best to get everything. but the details are really hard for me for me to remember in the moment and i feel like if i can’t get it perfectly asap then this one meticulous and rule bound shift is going to try her best to get rid of me. she absolutely hates me and i don’t feel respected by her as a human being. i don’t know what to do.",i think one of my shifts is going to try to get me fired

167,starbucks,"today i got yelled at by the rudest customer ever. i don’t know why starbucks rewards people with this behavior. my coworker took this lady’s order and she got a frap with 6 shots and a sandwich. my coworker told me that she wanted the frap split into to cups. i told her to tell her that our policy doesn’t allow us to do that. the most i can do is give her an empty cup so she can do it herself. my coworker was scared to tell her this and she asked me if i can do it. mind you, this lady is already at the window and starring me down while i make her frap. she was eyeing me the whole time when i poured her frap into the cup and rinsed out the blender. as soon as i opened the window this lady raised her voice and asked me why i dumped the rest of the left over drink that was in the blender down the sink. that i could have used the left over to pour to the second cup. i apologized and said that it is company’s policy that i’m not allowed to split it into two cups, the most i can do is give her an empty cup. she yelled at me and said “well why didn’t you tell me that in the first place! i paid for six shots of espresso!” i told her i’m so sorry but some baristas do not know that policy. she kept yelling and wanted a refund. she snatched the receipt and the pen out of my hand to sign the receipt. i explained that it would take at least 3-5 business days for the money to go back into your card and she went ballistic. i mean a full tantrum. full screaming, full flailing her harms and pounding on the steering wheel saying that she was left with $20 and she needs her money now. i literally told her “ma’am i understand but i don’t appreciate you yelling at me”. she kept interrupting me and kept yelling that she wanted her money back. i understand that she’s frustrated but i am no responsible on your actions of spending 17.01 at starbucks and i am not physically withholding your money. if you are truly broke, you would not stop by at starbucks. her drink alone was around $12. she wanted me to give her cash and she kept asking for a manager. that’s when my store manager stepped in and gave her entire order for free. i didn’t get in trouble. i actually got praised for trying to handle the situation in a calm manner but damn. the after affect of that scream had me shaking. really surprises me how a grown adult can have a tantrum over a cup of coffee.",venti sized rant

173,starbucks,"despite being one of many types of diabetes inducing syrups available for mass consumption in your local starbucks, by far the most violent and and hostile of all of these is the chai. the chai pump is a lightning fast, extraordinarily powerful pump that takes wicked joy in showering upon any barista who dares go near it or god forbid- pump some into a cup for your 8$ drink in highly adhesive liquid. unfortunately, a casualty was reported on this morn before the full rising of the sun. i pulled a sticker from the printer, it’s shears deciding my fate. i placed it upon a venti cold cup, and i quivered in my boots as i read “vt iced chai latte- 8 pumps chai”. i failed to swallow my fate come so soon, and shoved the cup under the dispenser to begin the perilous task of dealing with the rouge pump. i braced myself for the dreaded unwilling shower i was about to receive. i did not pull back my sorry head enough, and horrors! horrors! horrors! i felt a great sting in my eye, and a spray of chai- a violent jet of fury and sugar- spattered my face. like a valiant soldier struck in battle, i carried on with my battles, dodging the fury and fire of my enemy the chai pump. my eye burned, and i felt my lashes clumping fast as he poured the milk and ice into the latte. i handed the drink off, my compensated kindness making my face vizard to my torments. my eye, now red with the perils of my work, was screaming for my attention. i retreat to the den of stock and the ocean of filth, to nurse my wounds.

anyway, i understand that it is a very fast-paced place so the quality of my drink won't be the same every time. however, it would be nice to have a bit more consistency. i really like the taste of vietnamese iced coffee. i am addicted to that sweet milky coffee-forward flavor. i heard that the white chocolate mocha syrup mixed with espresso would be an accurate replication. i am not sure about the ratio. btw, i can't do grande or venti. i always go for tall.

i’m trying to find options for caffeinated beverage that i can stand the taste of. my college campus has a starbucks so i figure something there is my best shot. here’s a run down of what i’ve tried so far. 

1. i like the idea of tea but no matter what i try it’s always too watery and weak. when brewing at home i experimented and got to 1 tea bag per 2oz of water before giving. the only success i’ve had is peach snapple and that’s more like juice. 
2. i’ve found i like starbucks chai lattes if i add an extra pump of chai. i’m interested in trying other tea lattes but i don’t think starbucks has those so that’s not really relevant. 
3. i can’t stand the bitterness of coffee. last fall i tried the apple pie latte (think that’s what it was called) and was optimistic because i love apple stuff but the bitterness off the coffee was too much. i tried a frappe, cookie crumble i think, and i could still taste the coffee too much. honestly tasting the coffee at all will probably be too much. 


with all of this in mind, do any of you have recommendations for caffeinated drinks at starbucks i can try?

also, how terrible are “secret menu” items on baristas? especially interested in hearing from any student workers on here who worked at their college’s starbucks. i know there’s not an actual secret menu so just adding a bunch of stuff. i found some based off the chai drinks that could make for some nice variety but i don’t want to if it’s something that’s a pain in the butt for the person making it.

any advice would be really appreciated. i don’t want to keep buying drinks i can’t stand to finish but really want to find some way to consume caffeine.

i as you will see i started working at starbucks 2 weeks ago. so far enjoying it.

i think starbucks is unique in the sense that our menu is very large and extensive and making all the drinks to the desired specifications is sometimes challenging.

i want to build a simulation game in which you can make all the drinks from start to finish—starbucks drinks simulator /studio.

the hot and the cold bar. the steps the works 

i think the existence of such a game will reduce the training time, and resources spent training and will be a quality of life improvement for baristas trying to learn! it will make us learn quickly so we can go through all the recipes and learn more quickly. new recipes can also be added quickly if training can be done quickly.

 if you guys know anyone in corporate who could give me some resources to make this, that would be awesome !!   
i know i am a very low-level person working in the company but i feel like i can help make this training process fun and intuitive. i did this in a day imagine if i get the proper resources to build this complete game how much easy training will be and how fun it will be !!!  

this is just something that i thought of it's okay if you guys don't want to do it lol this i did just for fun!

if you can guys know anyone in the software team that would be really awesome!   
if they want to integrate the above quiz into the ott training and partner platform if they want the source code. i am willing to give that away as well. it would be an honor. i don't have access to it but i have watched videos on it!

221,starbucks,"i see a lot of posts about “service dogs” and esas and general pets in starbucks. 

pets and esas are not allowed. 
service dogs are. 

we are allowed to ask two questions; whether the dog is a service dog and what tasks they are trained for aiding in a disability. you cannot ask about the disability (visible or not) and you cannot require the dog to wear a vest or be visibly identified as a service dog, ask them to perform a task, require the handler to present paperwork confirming the dog is a service animal or about their disability (the list goes on and you can read more on the website i linked)

generally, many service dogs will be wearing vests or be visibly identifiable as a service dog. but again, not required. they are also not required to be on a leash only if the tasks they are trained for require the dog to be off leash (ex. getting help if the handler faints or has a medical spell, retrieving items, etc etc). 

please do not get yourself or your store into legal trouble for not following the law. you can legally ask those who are not in control of their dogs to leave, especially if they decide to treat a cafe floor as a restroom. be assertive but try not to escalate the situation.

i’m confused because i just got the official job offer email today, but it lists the other store location of the manager who interviewed me rather than the location i thought i’ll be working at (the one where i was interviewed at and the manager referred to this location throughout my interview, which is why i thought that’s the store i’ll be at).

is it possible the offer letter lists the other location because the manager who’s hiring me is from that location but is hiring for this other location (the one i planned on being at), so she will transfer my account over to this location in the system? or does this mean i’m hired for her location rather than the one i was interviewed at? has anyone here ever been hired by a manager for another location? 

i’m just confused and now wondering what location to show up at on my first day. it seemed clear in my interview that i’d be working at that location where the interview happened, not the location of the manager who was hiring me.

261,starbucks,"you can always ask the barista or look in the app to see the drink recipe. many drinks have classic syrup in them. you can substitute this with stevia packets, which is what i do. it has a slightly different taste but you can get used to it over time until you won’t notice it or won’t mind it. i love getting my drinks with stevia instead! you can ask the barista to make it with stevia or you can add the stevia yourself later. i recommend adding it yourself until you know how much you like. 

you can also try the drink without sweetener. some of the frappuccino’s, like the matcha creme frap, don’t need any sweetener in my opinion. 

i am not a dietician, but this is what i do to limit the added sugar in my drinks! 

i also usually get nonfat milk instead of whole milk for some drinks, and that makes the drink less calories overall. for frappuccino’s though, they come out too icy with nonfat milk, in my opinion, so i do 2% for frappuccino’s.

later on the partner who called out calls again and asks what was going on since apparently our sm didn’t bother to respond or call them back. 

all while having this conversation they had a very clearly annoyed tone to their voice. 

my question is, is this something that i should bring to hr or my dm? 
i’ve been with the company almost 4 years now and i’ve never had any issues with any sm with situations like this up until now.
to me it sounded like they were saying that i need to earn my wage which to me comes off as them using our recent pay raise against me which feels unethical.",possible unethical comment from sm not sure if i should talk to my dm or hr about it.
268,starbucks,"so i have a manager at my home store who i honestly can’t stand, she is extremely passive agressive and her way of coaching is less constructive criticism and more “you’re an idiot”. tonight was my last straw with her getting on me for wasting time cleaning dishes that she didn’t tell anyone was already cleaned and yelling at me about something i didn’t know wasn’t standard that another pm shift lead does and then coming to the back to tell me that she is only coaching me so i can be successful and that when she tells me something isn’t standard not to say back “oh (blank) taught me to do this”. i was fighting back tears because we only had a two partner play tonight and i was stressed already from throwing up multiple times at work. is that a valid reason to transfer stores or should i just suck it up cause she’s going to be the pm for most of the days i work now and i went from looking forward to my shifts to dreading them",can i transfer stores because of a manager.

274,starbucks,"so over the course of my 2 years the asm has always found a reason to pull me to the back to lecture me and each time has resulted in me ugly crying because when i say i'm doing my best they say my best isn't cutting it. it's usually about 1) not being able to go faster on bar during a rush hour 2) not being able to multi-task dto and dtw and count the change and take someone's order at the same time, or 3) today where i'm not being positive enough?? because customers assume i'm being rude since i'm monotone and have trouble maintaining a high fluid voice?

they always single me out for these things, take me to the back, and think reading starbucks pamphlets to me about our ""mission/values"" will some how make my brain neurotypical or something. like, how is asking a customer, when vanilla is out, ""we're out of vanilla right now, do you want to try caramel instead, or something similar?"" rude??? just because i don't have a woman's voice and can't go high and fluctuate means i'm not being positive? it's such bullshit. and then i also had to spill i have autism and that reading people and normal socializing is incredibly hard for me. now they're going to think i'm stupid or something and need to be babied. 

i've talked to my other co-workers and they say my asm doesn't treat anyone else like this. like if someone breaks a food item they usually let someone have it, but when it's with me they take it and throw it in the trash and go ""sorry, trash goes in the trash. you can't take broken food. you're more than welcome to mark it out though :)""

can, or where do i, report them for all of this? or keep a paper trail, because i have the feeling they're trying to aim for me being fired, and i'm getting tired of getting singled out for everything when i'm keeping times in the green just fine.",i keep getting lectured by my asm about starbucks core values when i have autism and adhd??

288,starbucks,"as the title says, i put in a transfer request 2 months ago because i was moving off to college. i let my then-sm know, and found a store in my college town that was willing to accept me.

right after i let my old sm know i was wanting to transfer, they left for another store. they weren't able to transfer me before they left, and them leaving pretty much put my old store into sm purgatory. from the moment they left to until when i moved, we never had a permanent sm. we alternated between being watched over by an asm-in-training, an sm-in-training, and an sm of another store in our district that was training to be dm. despite this, i was assured multiple times that my transfer would be completed in time for me to move. 

that didn't happen, though. to this day, i'm still in the system as working at my old store. i bothered the shit out of everyone i could think of, hoping that *someone* could help me transfer, but to no avail. i was told that since my old store doesn't officially have an sm, no one has ""access""  to transfer me except the dm, who seems either unable or unwilling to.

to make matters worse, the sm at my new store told me that i would start this week but i've only worked two shifts so far and i'm currently not scheduled *at all* for this week, next week, or the week after. my new sm says he'll fix it, but that was a couple of days ago and nothing's changed. i texted him again earlier today and haven't heard anything back.

i'm really fucking stressed about it and don't know what to do. my new store is low-volume and cafe-only, so i'm scared that there just isn't enough room to fit me into the schedule. i'm also scared that my new sm is already sick of dealing with me and doesn't want me to work at his store anymore.

i'm not really in the position where i can afford to not work for 2-3 weeks/indefinitely. i honestly really enjoy working at starbucks - the pay is decent compared to similar jobs, getting off at 11 or 12 is really convenient as a college student, and i'm good at my job. it's upsetting that i'm being forced to consider quitting a job i like for something i don't really feel is my fault.

290,starbucks,"hi, i’ve been officially hired by starbucks since 7/25 of this year, i didn’t begin my actual training until a few weeks later and now this is my final week of training. 

originally, i inquired about getting a job at starbucks because there’s a billion of them everywhere. i was scheduled to move in december of this year, and it would’ve been an easy job to pickup in my new town. now, my move is coming much sooner. my s/o was expecting a move with a new big-girl office job later in the year (december) but now it’s happening in october, before my 3 months are finished at starbucks. 

i was curious what my options are? i’m scared to bring any of this up to my sm or anyone in case of any type of ill-will or retaliation of some sort. my store is very understaffed and several other partners made it clear i was being rushed through training. i also of course do feel bad ditching them so soon especially since everyone there has been incredibly nice to me. idk if starbucks as a corporation will see me as a waste of their time and decide i’m not reliable enough to rehire. 

should i tell my sm about my new life changes? should i put in my 2-weeks a week or two before my 3 months have finished? what issues would this cause for me? would i have to start training all over again at a new store in my new city? would starbucks even hire me again after this?

no wonder it's good. it's loaded with sugar. wtf. i drink iced caramel macchiato every now and then from a similar company which has the same sugar content. apparently the small coffee has like 30+ grams of sugar. what the actual heck. 30 grams is like the daily limit! and i wish i was smarter but when you want a drink you don't really think of googling how much sugar is in it so i never knew. i wish they advertised it more clearly but obviously they wouldn't cause that would hurt sales.

i picked it up and immediately knew something was off. the syrup was sitting at the bottom of the drink, not incorporated at all, and the drink overall just ended up tasting weird. i’m still not sure what it was but it didn’t taste at all like a latte usually does from any other store.

so my question is - should i have just accepted that she wanted to make me a shaken espresso drink? did she *try* to make the espresso drink instead of my latte and it didn’t work out because yknow they’re different drinks? i’m just curious as to what happened to make it so…..bleh. it’s just espresso, milk, ice, and syrup. and unmixed syrup at that. i tried throwing my head back when i drank the first few sips to mix it and it just wasn’t working.

309,starbucks,"there’s a woman i am extremely uncomfortable serving now. she’s been a regular to my store for almost a year, always gets the same grande pike with 8 sugars and steamed cream. last friday, we had a super busy evening and the urns were all in the middle of getting urnexed by someone who went home sick. the karen came in and ordered her usual, i make a pour over because i don’t want to risk poisoning her with urnex because we have no idea what point in the cleaning routine any of the urns are at. i went heavier than she’d liked with the cream and she asked me to top it off with more coffee. i tell her we don’t have any brewed so i can either remake it if she’d like or add a shot. she got really pissed off, said “no, thank you” and stormed off and literally *threw her fucking drink all over all the cafe trashes*. at this point in my head i’m worried she’s gonna go home and call corporate, my coworkers are shocked. i tried to be accommodating, we had no usable urns, and all i could do was either redo the pour over or add a shot like i offered. thought that encounter was over with, but she came through my drive thru tonight and ordered the cream and sugar on the side. at the dt window, my coworker asks her why she’s ordering it on the side now. the karen starts going off about how the other day a barista didnt get her drink right and how it took every ounce of her being not to throw her drink in my face and she starts describing what i look like. when i started ringing up another customer from the box at the dt, she saw me and hid her face. i truly hope she was embarrassed that i heard that she was talking to my coworker about how much she wanted to disfigure my face with hot coffee because her cream wasn’t light enough one time out of the year i’ve been making her stupid ass 3 dollar drink. with the way she reacted with the cafe trash, i truly believe she wanted to throw it in my face, and i feel extremely uncomfortable ever interacting with her ever again. will i get in trouble with corporate if i refuse to serve her?",can you refuse service as a barista?

however after becoming a ssv i realized how many things were wrong with my location. there was never any ssv meetings, trainings were never really done properly, and the manager was just a major jerk that would like to bully the men on the job.

stop recording your baristas. whether they're making your drink, handing you your drink, taking your order, etc. stop it.

additionally, drive thrus need to install cameras to protect baristas. i know that can't be the only person who has come across 'public flashing' p*rn that directly involves unknowing baristas.

my order has been a caramel frappuccino w/ extra ice, extra caramel, double blended &amp; in a venti cup. 

usually i’ll order and i don’t get any feedback and if i’m at a new starbucks i preface it by saying i have a complicated order just in case. i don’t order if the line is long and i never complain if it’s not in a venti cup. i do not expect the cup to be full. i do expect to be charged for extra caramel. if there was a charge for the cup, i have paid that, too. i work in retail so my ice melts in the back room while i’m assisting guests. the extra ice helps my drink last a while longer. 

today i ordered and after reading back my order, i asked the barista if she heard me ask for a venti cup. it flashed on the screen a couple of times like she couldn’t find the right button, so when she told me to pull up, i didn’t think anything of it. when i get to the window, it’s in a grande cup. i didn’t complain or anything but after reading a bit here i am wondering if that was intentional? 

i don’t want to be a bad customer. can i make this less annoying for them? should i go drop off some chocolates for being annoying? idk??

349,starbucks,"how long does ethics give decision after the investigation?

this will be a pretty long story/rant. please try to understand as english is not my first language 

2 partners filed an ethics complaint plus 2 incident reports (a witness report and a green bean) against the same ssv.

ssv apparently called a partner from a minority a slave. partner reported the incident to the manager but manager just shrugged the incident off and even told the partner to not tell it to other partners as manager is afraid that other partners will get mad at ssv and will bully ssv. we already knew that this ssv and sm are particularly close and lets ssv gets away from any complaints. instead of giving ssv corrective action or coaching for the racism issue, sm nitpicks on the partner for every little thing even some things aren't true. there was also a second time with the same partner where ssv asked if partner lives on a gh**to area. partner also reported the incident but nothing was done. so we convinced partner to call ethics instead. partner was able to talk to the dm before they moved to another province. partner later found out that our sm called the store sm that they're going to transfer to and said bad things about partner to prevent partner from being accepted to the store.

another ethics complaint and 2 ir are related.
ssv aggressively followed a green bean from inside the store to the parking lot and yelled at green bean in front of many customers and partners which i feel is against third place policy and anti-harassment. even though green bean didn't notify ssv (which ssv is hardly on the floor working) that gb clocked out, ssv should just coach gb properly. gb told the incident to sm but blamed gb instead on how gb is being inconsiderate and non-cooperative. gb told another ssv about what happened and felt it was unfair so they filed a complaint for gb. gb and other witnesses also filed incident reports which notified our sm and it pissed our sm off. the investigation started 2 weeks ago where dm asked people who filed the ir and complaints as well as other baristas.


  many partners also talked to ssv and sm directly on how ssv is being aggressive and acting like a bully to other partners(especially green beans) instead of coaching them properly but nothing happens to ssv instead sm nitpicks/blames partners who complains about ssv and sometimes would cut their hours.


tl;dr 
partners filed ethics complaints and incident reports against the same ssv for racism and being a bully towards green beans. partners tried to have a talk several times with ssv and sm for the aggressive behavior but no corrective action is taken and sm is always covering up ssv.  investigation was started 2-3 weeks ago and partners are losing hope that the results will still fall into ssv's favor. how long will it take till they would release the decision if they're going to transfer the ssv?",ssv who is racist and a bully to partners especially green beans

you see that ""lol""? i added that to lighten the *mood* but i really feel like things are getting bad. id consider myself a ugly duckling. wasn't the most pleasing guy to look and the ugly friend of my group when i was younger to being told by men and women i'm really good looking often and all my friends sort of following my lead. all that is cool and all but it causes a lot of unwanted attention for a man who still hasn't left their ugly duck mindset.

it may seems like i'm being braggadocios i apologize if anyone is taking it that way but i'm only pointing this out because i feel like its effecting my work. so as we all know starbucks is a very female dominated brand. from the customers to the staff (at least in my store) i'm starting to have women compliment me a lot. which is so cool because i know a lot of people are shy but i have no idea how to respond without being awkward.

 i don't want to come off as unapproachable but i keep messing these things up dude. a lot of the time i wouldn't mind having a conversation with these folks but i get shy around new people and overthink. i don't want to get fired over this. most of my partners are great people but a select few feel like i'm favored by our manager and critique everything i do. starbucks is supposed to be a social place! my manger is the best she always gives me reassurance but i'm starting to think that's just because she may fancy me (not just based of that, there are other things i don't need to go in detail about)

 i don't want anyone to think i'm unapproachable or stuck up when i'm really just to in my own head. i have a fellow barista who is pretty cute she looks like zoe kravitz who's my celebrity crush. this girl has thrown me so many ""just fucking interact with me you curly headed bastard"" signs and tried sparking conversations and i still overthink saying a simple hi and bye to her

you may read that thinking *""how can you know all this and not be confident enough to converse""* and it comes down to being that guy who would think someone is flirting with him when they were actually doing the complete opposite. i'm not dumb after awhile i can start to tell this isn't just them being nice but id rather deny and be safe then sorry.

the management of my store is very bad in general. we are so understaffed to the point that i’ve had to solo my store for a few hours at a time. we used to close at 8pm, but closed at 2pm today because we were so understaffed.

i really just want the old recipe, 3 shots of espresso shaken with 3 pumps of white mocha, with a splash of milk/cream on top. but whenever i try to modify the drink, it still is always sooo milky! even when i tell the baristas i don’t care if the cup is filled to the top alll the way or not. (i definitely get why they do that, seeing all the posts on this sun about customers complaining lol)

i’ve tried ordering it in a tall cup, ordering it with extra ice, etc. still really inconsistent and usually still overly milky. 
it seems like the closest way to order it is a iced triple espresso, 3 pumps of white mocha, and a splash of cream. but the espresso and syrup are never stirred together. ):

ex-partner x2 here. i worked at starbucks 2013-2018, then mar 2021 - oct 2021 before landing (what i thought was) a more stable full time job. 

spoiler alert: it was not.

now i’m thinking about returning to starbucks. i will say, i definitely enjoyed my time during my first five years more than i enjoyed it this last time. with the recipe changes, new policies, covid, it wasn’t my favorite - plus i was starting at an extremely high volume store for our area, and they didn’t really train me again because i’d spent five years with the company previously. (which is whatever, but things had changed, so it would’ve been nice to know them beforehand and not told them while doing something wrong on the floor.)

i don’t think the pay has changed for every store in my area, though. last year, i was making $13 for the few months i spent as a ssv, but i know they were talking about raising pay. i see barista postings on indeed around here from $10-$15 an hour, so who knows. 

but i’m only making $16 now, they’re cutting my hours, and i’m considering moving back to the bux and working my way up this time. as long as i can find a location around me paying at least $15.

so. baristas and ssvs of reddit, how are we liking it nowadays? i know the company is under a lot of fire for the union stuff, but as a day to day job, how are we feeling? pros/cons? advice? etc?

i’ve been a partner for about 10 months now and i can say that i genuinely enjoy working at starbucks. the teams i’ve worked with have made it worthwhile but i feel like i keep constantly getting caught in the cross fire of something and a customer being shitty to me because of it. i don’t really know how to defend myself because things happen so fast. i’m really sick orders being backed up and customers are rude to me because peak at my current store is a lot and even though us partners handle it well it will still take time because there’s only so much we can do. i’ve dealt with rude customers before and i just brushed it off but this morning i kind of lost it mentally . food was so packed and a customers order took a while to hand off while i was doing dto and i didn’t really get anxious because we were all just doing the best we could. the next guy that drives up comes and he throws a bunch of change at me and he starts screaming “give me the coffee im late to work jesus fucking christ ” and i was quickly trying to count the change and he was like “the fucking coffee please!” and it was so loud that i know everyone inside heard and i was so embarrassed and no one asked if i was okay and i just had to suck in the tears because there was no time to cry as i just wanted to keep the dt times as low as i could while soloing. i’m just tired of how customers project so much when things are not my fault . honestly you’re not going to get your drink in 2 minutes at 9:00am on a weekday. it was ironic because before i took his order there was already a line ??? it honestly destroys how much i enjoy this job and i find it really annoying. i’ve gotten belittled because we ran out of ice coffee and matcha, got yelled at bc i put a  sleeve on someone’s drink (with hot water) or at the fact that i charged someone for chocolate cold foam on a drink that wasn’t a chocolate cold brew. tbh i’m just very mad rn bc i feel embarrassed and humiliated and i try not to take things personal but i’m able to admit this got to me. customers make me feel so dumb. this post is kind of a safe area if anyone feels the same way. i don’t care if anyone thinks this is corny because i am human. thank you for reading. any tips on emotional resilience midst this would be appreciated as well :)

423,starbucks,"so today our store got a spontaneous call that another store was short staffed and in need of any free baristas. i volunteered and headed over. to my surprise, i ended up solo handling register, bar, and food warming for about an hour. there was a steadily growing line of customers and it was pretty stressful. there was a shift manager doing who the heck knows what? i asked them to help me make drinks at one point. they literally picked up a cup, put a sticker on it, and said they had to “handle” something. surprisingly all the customers were patient and many of them said “i was working very hard.” i even got a large tip from a kind customer. it was just a genuinely crazy experience. i jokingly told a shift manager from my own store and she said that “that was not okay treatment for me to have received.”",i soloed the entire floor

430,starbucks,"hi guys. i literally just had to get on here and rant because i’m feeling so unseen. the other day i had a customer come up to me after my 10 demand that i look for her drink even though i had no clue who she was, what her drink was, or any of the sort. so i start to get a little bit of a tone with her and i’m ok so what was it? she tells me the drink, i start making it. as i’m pulling her shots i turn around to my sweet cream foam for another drink because you know: sequencing. she then runs to the front register and slams her keys on the counter and says “i feel like my drink should’ve been done by now and she’s still not making it. i’ve been waiting for 30 minutes.” and i would understand your frustration too if you had been waiting 30 minutes for your drink but i just got on the floor 3 minutes ago, and from my perspective i usually start to question my drinks readiness after about 10 minutes. so i found it hard to believe that 30 minutes was really bothering her when she could’ve came up earlier, so she must’ve been content and occupied with something else, but that’s just me. so after i tell her i’m making her drink, she yells you know? whatever it’s fine. but right before she left the door she yells “go f*ck yourself” to me where i rebutted back with a “f*ck you, b*tch” mind you i was already having a bad day as it was and this just added fuel to the fire. never in my 3 years of working for starbucks had i ever said that to a customer. i’ve suffered through verbal abuse my whole life and it just triggered something inside me where i felt i needed to protect myself and so that’s what came out. i’m not a rude person and i don’t want this to be a reflection of who i am. i made a mistake. but i’m tired of these customers thinking they can just say whatever they want to us. ill miss my barista friends and regulars. bye starbucks",whatever cup size rant

it feels weird because it’s an easy task so saying no doesn’t make sense, but i don’t want to get her water and bring it to her.  since she’s my boss, it just feels like i can’t say no. she does this with all of my coworkers and nobody seems to have a problem with it, but idk it really just feels like she’s demanding rather than asking.

441,starbucks,"so i am a former partner, wasn’t a partner very long (about a year) but i have been close to starbucks for about 10 years. i actually met my wife when she worked at starbucks and became very close to her friends most of which worked at starbucks (some still do!). during my time as a ssv i saw many opportunities for improvement within my district and saw first hand a lot of the downsides i had heard about for many years from my wife and friends. since i left the company to be a stay at home dad i’ve been keeping up with friends and the news regarding unionization. i have this pull to want to come back and help the people i worked with while also helping the company be its very best. i’ve come up with this position that i think could be vital in helping the company bridge the gap between stores on the brink of unionization. my problem is i don’t know how to best get my ideas to the ears the matter, without just dumping everything on the internet in a bunch of word vomit. does reddit have any advice for a stay at home dad who wants to work and help partners and starbucks alike?  is there someone i could contact with the company to pitch my idea?",purposing a new starbucks position
442,starbucks,"so today i was given a written warning for time and attendance which had verifiably false information on it. it said they received the call at 4:40 for my shift starting at 5:30 which by ""starbucks standards"" is not acceptable because it is within an hour which is not proper advance notice. only problem is i have proof on my phone of the call logs where i had called the store at 4:28am and talked to the shift letting them know i was having diarrhea and could not come in. mind you, i woke up only at 4:20am and as soon as i could upon feeling that i was sick and having these issues. issues that are against food and safety procedures and a major health code violation.   


so, i showed my phone logs to my sm, who then told me that it is ""still within that hour"" and upheld the written warning. apparently, he thinks i'm stupid enough to believe 62 minutes is less than 60 minutes of notice, or that somehow the policy changed and even though everyone has been told ""1 hour"" over and over and over again, it's now no longer 1 hour?  


and now i am at home, about to call up the business ethics and compliance number to clear my name and get this written off my name because it not only affects my job security, but an upcoming planned transfer across the country. unless i am blind, the attendance and punctuality policy does not state any specific time period for the ""advanced notice"" so is this just some fluid number that managers can make up on the spot to screw you over? because, like i've said, i've always been told 1 hour. by my former manager, by this manager, and i've had a written warning before (which was justified maybe) as i had called off only 30 minutes before my shift in an emergency and he reiterated that it had to be 1 hour of advanced notice.   


so i did exactly that. i woke up, felt sick, had diarrhea, called off 1 hour and 2 minutes ahead of my scheduled shift, and now i am being written up. what the hell can i do? i already wrote an email to the business and ethics email on my way home, and plan to call them shortly. am i in the right here or are they going to find some way to fuck me over?",attendance and punctuality policy

the issue is, when i drove up to the window, the manager behind the window barista asked me, in a rude tone, if i'd rather fill up the empty space with water or get my venti cup half filled instead? i was completely taken aback and didn't know what to say lol. i said whichever??

then when she handed me the drink i said that i've been ordering this drink for years and no one's ever asked me that. she said people must've been making a bunch of assumptions then.

506,starbucks,"i’m a relatively new barista, only 3 months or so. but i’ve been working my butt off! scrambling to take shifts at other stores, grabbing overtime hours like oliver begging for porridge and really putting the green siren first in my life. trying to build the seed of a career. i like my job, i like working at a coffee shop, i just need more money to grow beyond bare subsistence. 

unlike most partners, i actually really enjoy engaging with customers and have gotten pretty good reviews. in fact my store’s engagement number has grown from the teens to the forties in the months since i’ve been hired. it would be assumptive and egotistical to say it’s my fault, but i feel fair in saying i’ve made a meaningful contribution to the stores growth already. so much so my store qualified for a new managers assistant. 

no i didn’t expect to get promoted. the way it was explained  to me, i’m basically waiting in line before an arbitrary time, like a year or something before they allow me to really advance beyond maybe a trainer. 

but instead of promoting one of the many qualified and capable veterans locally she hired some random new guy she said has “previous management experience” i meet him, and talk for like 2 minutes. apparently what she meant to say is by “previous management experience” is that he’s fresh from the army (not an officer mind you) just a regular army guy, young guy, my age. i guess “previous management experience” sounds better than “troopers skip the line peasant.” like, if the guy had some retail experience managing a mcdonald’s or something, i could reconcile that. but i was showing this guy how the register worked and it was clear he was super green to retail as an industry. 

i feel so…..hurt. deflated. again i did not expect to get the promotion. but expected my new superior to be…more qualified than me? like i’m sure the army has given him skills. but i doubt they are starbies retail skills. he’s this newbie just trying to soak in everything. just like me a couple months ago. and like, what about my fellow more experienced partners? it just makes me feel like our hard work is worthless. just cogs waiting for someone from a higher social caste to be privileged the boons of our hard work!

this is too much. i feel like i’m doing the work of 3 people, and when we’re understaffed then i’m doing the work of 4 bc we need restocks/ice/cleaning. 

i personally feel like a shift should be planted on cs so they can resolve issues without disrupting flow, step away to do their tasks without interruptions, have more time to focus on partner breaks and plays, etc.

509,starbucks,"this may not go over well but i have to get this off my chest. let me start off with: we all know hours are getting cut and there isn’t enough coverage ever anymore. it sucks and i’m tired of doing the work of 3 and i know a lot of you guys are as well, it’s a shitty situation to be in. but at my store we have a lot of baristas that view this job as just something to do because they’re bored. most of them that have this mindset are 30-40 year olds and don’t actually need this job, which they make very clear (they used to be stay at home moms mostly). they only work maybe 8-10 hours a week give or take. they’ve all been here a year and still cannot sequence or make drinks properly (they’ve been given plenty of practice and coaching i promise) they also cannot really work any position with any sort of excellence and it’s getting very frustrating to pick up their slack every 5 minutes that i’m on the floor with them. so even with the lack of coverage needed i’m still getting the barista here that cannot or just flat out refuse to do their job with any sort of urgency. they don’t ask questions, they shirk off standards and i have to deal with a lot of angry customers because of them. they’re taking away hours from people that need and/or want them and taking up space from baristas that are actually competent at the job (that have been there the same amount of time). am i being a jerk? i’ve tried to give them a lot of grace but i’m already doing more work because of the lack of coverage and i don’t want to be doing even more just because a few baristas don’t want to do their job (they all get scheduled for peak to mid btw). i know i’m a shift and i need to be the one to make up for certain things, but i really wish i didn’t have to hold their hands all the time, they’ve been here a year i give them practice in every position, every chance i get, but there is no sense of urgency and i’ll coach on standard (and so will some other baristas) and they just shrug it off and then i have to deal with an angry customer. 

seriously am i being a huge jerk? i just don’t want to have to keep holding the hand of a barista that doesn’t even care about the job.  i know it’s just a job and not that serious but i get chewed out by my sm when a barista isn’t doing their job properly.",trenta rant of a very burnt out ssv

511,starbucks,"for context, i was hired in late july. i've worked a few weeks now, coming up on a month. i'm only scheduled around 20 hrs/week. i'm still learning and not comfortable yet with everything. most of the longtime employees have been really nice and understanding, except one. i don't know maybe we got off on the wrong foot or i'm reading him wrong. i'll just give some examples. one day, i was on cold bar making fraps. it came peak time when everyone started ordering fraps. i ran out of base and frap chips. i needed them for the next fraps so i'm running around frantically trying to restock while there's a line of cups forming with frap labels. he comes over, sees the line of cups, says ""you need to be sequenc- nevermind, just go on your 10"" and takes over. i just said ""i'm sorry"", changed out the empty bases for him and then went on break. i watched him from the end of the bar slam through the fraps i failed to make. he forcefully slammed the blender cover with each frap. it felt really passive agressive. after that day, everytime i've worked with him as shift lead he puts me on dt. i feel like i'm being punished for that one bad day. anyway, this last time i was on dt he was watching me all shift. all day he just kept chiming in with unhelpful advice. i'm not comfortable yet taking orders while away from the pos but he keeps telling me to start taking orders while i'm putting pastries in the oven or doing something else. ""it takes some memorization"" he said. which felt so condescending and like he just wants to flex his skills over me. also that day, i was bent over counting change for a customer at the window and he's standing there over me and tells me again that i need to start taking the order at the speaker box. my mind can't processing counting change and listening to the customer at the speaker box ordering a venti iced white mocha, quad shot, blonde, ristretto, 4 pumps toffee nut, whatever the fuck else. i had been welcoming them and telling we'd be with them in a moment. i don't understand how you're supposed to take the order at the speaker box and be personable to the customer at the window. if i'm listening/talking with customer over the headset, the most i can do is hand drinks to the customer at the window and smile. all day he made the same comments that i need to ""multitask"", when i'm obviously not comfortable doing that yet. i don't reply which i think pisses him off more. the most i say to him is ""oh, okay. thanks."" i went in today on my day off to get coffee. he was working. others working said hi to me. i know he had to have seen me in the cafe. then he didn't even read my name on my drink and just called out my order. i vented to my mom about all of this and she just told me ""you're going to work with assholes everywhere you work"". which is probably true. i'm hoping honestly he'll just go away. he boasts about possibly moving away in a few months to a bigger city and getting a ""real job"". which again is so douchey and condescending. he acts like he's above the rest of us. i wanted to tell him you jackass, you and i working here in the same place, just trying to get by like everyone else. i could go on and on about every interaction that's irked me about him, but i feel like i've go on too long already.",advice for dealing with a passive agressive shift lead?

523,starbucks,"i am a senior in high school. i get early release only on b days but not a days. a and b days are where on one day you have a set of 3-4 classes and on the next day you have another set of 3-4. let’s say you have maths on a days, you would not go back to that class until the next a day. so you get a day off from that class. anywho i told my sm that i would keep him updated on whether or not i ended up getting early dismissal. i ended up getting it but only on b days meaning that i don’t get it everyday. it would be hard to create a schedule with me getting early release on every b day. so the schedule was created and some of the shifts were too early for me. some of the shifts i got were too early that even though i do have early release i still wouldn’t be able to work that early on a school day. i changed my availability until no earlier than 4:30 everyday bc it’s much easier. until then i have to find coverage for the remaining shifts until another schedule gets made. most of my coworkers all are in college so we will all be in school and it’s not gonna be easy for us to cover each others shifts. i asked my coworkers and they can’t cover. i don’t know what else to do besides telling my sm but i want to keep my hours. i am still able to make it to these shifts i just need the days where i don’t get out early to be pushed back a tad bit. should i just communicate to him bc i know he will understand? or look harder for coverage?",what to do if you can’t find any coverage but still want your hours?

i've been told about the cup fund when i first joined but i never really got a full talk on it and i was told this maybe mid-june, i'm still a green bean. 

my questions are if you're a part-time partner, are you still eligible for this cup fund, if so, what are the requirements?

can pets be an exception to the fund if something were to ever happen?

what's the process of getting provided the money?

can the fund be used on family like parents, uncles/aunts, etc?

591,starbucks,"i want to start off by saying, today is the last day for sign-ups, so hurry up and get it done! 

with that out of the way, for those that suffer from mental health ailments, i want to say, our benefits do not help us or those who suffer. none of their medical plans offer any options with mental health, none. so, if you have or can gain state medical, do it! you’ll have a better chance of receiving help rather than paying x amount to find out that you do not qualify. lyra is only good for those that have minor issues and can use simple one on one therapy sessions, but some of us need more than just that, like dbt services, medication, etc.   


so in other words, we sign up for what? spend our money on what? the company earned 8.1 billion last year and these are the services offered to us? they barely give a pay raise to any of the states, hire someone to union bust, and this is also what we receive, the bare minimum! what a great company that operates behind fallacy, a false notion of “happy partners create happy customers”.  

if you cannot pay us a livable wage you might as well give us better benefits, if not, then we are below min. wage slaves.   


if this is how they treat us, the people who made their billions, then i do not mind taking matter into my own hands and teaching people how to make better coffee, espresso pulls, cold brew, etc. from their own home at a fraction of the cost. their beans aren’t the greatest, they continually tell the customers that they are “hand picked”, “best quality ever”, and “you cannot compare their economical resourcing and safe practices”. if you must know, they are hand picked, but by whom? people they pay even less than us. their quality is subpar to grocery store beans that aren’t properly stored, some blends are way too oily and others are way too dry, some you can tell have been expired before their date, you can obviously tell they aren’t properly handled! their economical safe practices are unethical, the people who farm the beans do not live happily, actually the vast majority of them still live in poverty!   


you can create better quality drinks at home from local roasters or online sources that roast their beans with more heart than these soulless bloodsuckers! you can steam milk using a modified moka pot, or you can buy a stove top steamer, and use a moka pot for your espresso beans, you can create your own syrups at a fraction of the cost! cold brews are super easy to make and you can make them even stronger than what the company offers!! hot coffee and iced coffee is far cheaper to brew at home than to shop at the company. starbucks quality is a scam, with heavily processed sugar syrups, you pay for the cups and not the coffee, the cups, lids, straws, utensils cost more than the beans!!! 

just because the company is advertised and is popular, doesn’t mean they are ethically safe, economically great, and overall the best option. it might be time for folks to learn how to do things on their own again and not rely of convenience; convenience, cups, utensils, bags, etc. is the only thing you are truly paying for! btw, the more you support major coffee companies like this, you are furthering the extinction of the beans itself.

625,starbucks,"well, i guess since my last post did well i’ll keep on posting so i keep getting the hang of this reddit thing. 

we recently had to ban a customer. here’s why:
i was on cafe bar making the orders and i’m about to start one and the guy goes “hey hey hey hold on. i’m gonna walk you through how to make my drink”
proceeds to bark orders at me. he wanted me to make the iced latte with no ice and then slowly take that and pour it over a cup of ice and squeeze the cup as i did it. any time i would go too quickly he would yell at me and say go slower. all so he can have a extra half scoop of ice on top. i’m the shift but with situations where it’s me making the drink and getting yelled at i freeze up. so i told myself next time i would not let it happen again. 
apparently he’s a regular i never have to deal with and everyone is scared of him. 

the next time he did the same thing, said “i’m gonna help you make it” 
i ignored him. he told me to fill the milk to the second line and i said “you mean the standard procedure?” and he didn’t really know how to respond. after that i ignored him. i made it the way you’re supposed to and he went “wait wait wait” i said “what was that?” and handed him his drink and a cup of ice on the side. he didn’t really know what to do at that point so he left. 

i told my store manager about this guy because it had been getting out of hand. 

i wasn’t here for the thing that got him banned thannk god. but he came in and did it to a barista and was leaning over yelling while playing with a knife very close to her. basically threatening her to make the drink correctly. and then she didn’t make it exactly how he wanted and another barista tried to remake it and the customer proceeded to scream and cuss everyone out, pointing the knife at them, and leave. came back in and threw the drink and then called several times screaming and cussing. banneddddd bebeee.

629,starbucks,"this might be kinda lengthy so sorry in advance. 

july 5th or so i sprained my ankle pretty bad and have been on work restrictions of only working 4 hours maximum per shift per doctors orders. my sm keeps scheduling me for over the 4 hours that i am allowed to work and expecting me to find the coverage for the remainder of my shift, which to me is not right or fair because he knows i’m only supposed to work 4 hours. 

about two weeks ago he wrote me up due to attendance, which i thought was reasonable (to an extent because i did use some sick time for said call offs) because i did have a problem like 2-3 months ago with attendance due to some mental health issues. 

fast forward to this week i’m on the schedule for 5.75 hours for monday and tuesday yet again. he sends me home on monday at the 4 hour mark without a problem. tuesday he’s working from home, but my shift sends me home at the 4 hour mark as well. wednesday he comes in and says “what happened yesterday? why did you leave early?” i kept my cool and calmly stated “because i can only work 4 hours per doctors orders, but you’ve known this for over a month now” his response was “this schedule was already made before you went on restrictions, you need to start getting the rest of the shifts covered that you are scheduled over your allotted time” he makes the schedule maybe 2-3 weeks in advance if that, so it definitely wasn’t made before i went on restrictions. he then said that he has spoken to our regional manager and they have both agreed that we need to “get this figured out” (i have an mri scheduled for today so it’s not like i’m just not trying to figure out what is really going on with my ankle) but he hasn’t given me any help or direction on how he wants me to figure it out. 

so fast forward again to yesterday, i go in and he’s doing the normal “how are you feeling? do you feel sick?” i told him that i think i ate something the night before that didn’t agree with my stomach because it hurt pretty bad, and also told him that my ankle was in a tremendous amount of pain, so i might not be 100% my usual self or as fast as usual but i’m there and i’m pushing through. he exploded on me and literally said, and i quote “ you can’t go home early, you’re out of sick time. i’ve been using your sick time when you clock out early and there’s no coverage.” i didn’t even imply that i was trying to go home early for one. for two, i never gave him permission to use my protected sick time for me “leaving early”.  i was under the impression that sick time was only to be used if you wrote it in the book that you wanted to use it or if the sm asked you and you said yes. is that not correct?

at the end of the day, i’m looking for the place that treats their employees well, handles staffing well, and pays good money.

i think both places do this pretty well, and i’d like to know how they both operate. share your thoughts: old and new. if you’re from california even better!",starbucks or in-n-out? which is the better environment to work in?
640,starbucks,i was pretty sure it existed but trying to find it. i got corrected about wearing my apple watch today and want to make a recommendation to change the apple watch rule so we can wear them on shift. i used to be a shift and qasa lead and so i’m used to dating everything- and literally saves so much time to be able to refer to what time and what date it is easily. and aren’t we still supposed to date dot everything? so why make it harder to do so?,where on the partner starbucks page do you go to to make recommendations?
641,starbucks,"starmbunks sucks, here's why-

1. horribly inconsistent hours, tomorrow i am working 4-12, then the day after i work 12- close. open one day, close the next, this is also right after i finished a vacation, so that's really cool.
2. the quality of coffee beans is consistently poor. they /could/ get fantastic tasting beans, and better brewing standards but instead we get over roasted shlock, but of course it cuts into their profits.
3. lousy pay - 50 cents above minimum wage is super gaming the system, hella not cool. especially in larger cities, and richer areas.
4. i worked my 6 months, looks good on my resume, and i got a way better job at a local ma and pa. 
5. tip splitting, ssv's shouldn't get a bigger ratio of tips per hours worked than barista's. i don't bother being nice to customers anymore. 

putting in my two weeks tomorrow, but i'm probably just gonna walk out on my shift when some crazy shit happens, which it inevitably will.",quitting! (and why)

648,starbucks,"some backstory: so about a 4 months ago my store got a new assistant store manager, then a month ago my store got a new store manager. both of them being outside hires that have never worked for starbucks before. 

so today i was in the middle of training some baristas for the store that is about to open near us and in walks my manager and he asks to talk to me for a minute. i walk to the front where they were sitting and he basically starts explaining to me that i have to sign a corrective action paper because i called out for 5 days a month ago. the reason i called out is because my little brother (16) had been rushed to the hospital due to his crohn’s disease. this hospital being over an hour away and my mom not being able to miss work because she’s a manager made it so i was the only one able to stay with him. so i called my asm (we had yet to meet the new sm) and explain my situation. she tells me that it’s okay considering i was only scheduled to be training and to keep her updated. well the following monday i go back to work and i have a doctors note from the hospital explaining why i was out. i logged my sick time and it was signed and approved no problem. (as we are allowed to use sick time towards helping immediate family) so i guess i’m just confused on why i was given a corrective action form for a issue that happened over a month ago for something my manager knew about and that i wasn’t able to control? 

another thing, i’ve been with the company for almost a year this month on the 30th and the new store i mentioned is in need of a shift supervisor. i applied and when i was given this corrective action form my manager informed me that it won’t damage my possibly for the position but i can’t help but be concerned especially since with my brother’s disease everything is unexpected. should i be worried?",had to sign a corrective action form today.

653,starbucks,"tldr: does steaming vanilla bean powder clog the machine when steaming with milk? 

for the past probably 8+ years i've been ordering a chai latte and over the years come to a specific order.
-venti chai tea latte
-7 chai
-no water
-2 scoops vanilla bean powder steamed with the milk

i've had many baristas tell me they just steam it with the milk even when i don't ask but we moved to a new house and therefore a new store so i've made sure to order it that way. for the last 5 months they've made it and all of a sudden a new to me person tells me they can't steam the powder it clogs the machine but they can dump it in the chai before adding milk.

so my question is does the vanilla bean powder actually clog the machine? am i making way more work for baristas ordering this way? 

i'm frustrated that this one person after over 8 years of ordering keeps saying something no one else in this (or any) store has ever said.  i didn't just come up with ordering this way, baristas told me they steamed the milk or offered to before i ever tried to order it that way.",a question for baristas

 i don't really care which location i visit as there are always a few ""on the way"" to my destination. it would be nice if there were a ""busy location"" indicator. this could be triggered by number of orders in queue, current wait time, a manager choosing it in case of broken equipment, or even just scheduled at common rush times.",wouldn't it be nice if the mobile app allowed users to select ordering locations based on wait time?

my situation is… unique i guess you can say.

i am a business administration major at my university (not asu). i took accounting and liked it enough that i wanted to major in it. unfortunately, my university would only allow it if i took additional courses. my financial aid does cover tuition… and unfortunately i’m almost at my max year (6 years is the limit i suppose). i would have to pay out of pocket eventually and i can’t afford that. 

when i heard asu offered accounting, i didn’t quit starbucks to receive the benefit. i applied for accounting as my first choice. they made me pick a second choice just in case and did business administration. 

unfortunately, i only got in business administration and not accounting. i was sad lol. 

i checked the requirements (i have a high gpa for my university, so i was confused on what’s going on and i had over 60 credits which they require you have 30 or more college credits). turns out i need a pretty high gpa for high school as well. or have a high sat score… even be 8% of the graduate class? that was wild to me… but long story short i didn’t turn in a high school transcript and maybe that’s why i was rejected? i accidentally mistook corporate accounting (does not need high school transcripts) with normal accounting (which does need hs transcripts). 

luckily for me, high school gpa must be 3.4 to be considered. i graduated with low honors with a 3.5 gpa… maybe 3.6 can’t remember it well. i believe my school gpa system was the same as arizona… but i’m not 100% sure. 

i’m scared i’ll turn in the transcript and still be rejected or if it’s too late. 

is there something else i could do? i heard about pathway to admission helping partners boost their gpa to get admitted. maybe that could help me? or is it only for certain situations? 

has anyone else been in this situation ? 

any advice is appreciated!

thank you!",scap question regarding being accepted into majors with more requirements for asu…

i have no idea what to do. i need to be able to afford to live and currently it seems like i do not have a job. if anyone could offer some advice or maybe explain better what is happening it would be greatly appreciated &lt;3",new sm not scheduling me or even contacting me after my transfer was approved
695,starbucks,"hello everyone. esp customers :)
customers❗️psa‼️
when you approach the barista that’s on the register, saying “can i get an ice coffee?” is not telling me what you want! and than we have to say “black? anything inside?” and what do ya say? “oh no can i get that with vanilla and cream?” … if you know your ice coffee order, please say everything one time!!! “can i get an ice coffee with vanilla and cream?” not so hard is it??

having to continuously ask “anything inside?” gets so annoying esp when you know what you want inside your coffee. this extends to hot coffee as well. don’t wait until the transaction is complete to say “oh can i get that with oat milk?” … -_-",customers: say what you want when you order ice coffee/ cold brew!

when you're ordering coffee, latte, cold brew, ice coffee, americanos.  **state that you want cream/milk/sugar**. 

 it's been 3 flipping years since stores have taken their cream, milk, sugar section away.  my tongue is tired of uttering the words "" anything in that?"" and then being met with incomprehensible/undecisive ""*oh uh..  uh let me text my coworker, this isn't mine*!"" or the "" *oh, you guys put it in?*"" like, ***richard***, you come here every other day?? 

and even worse, my baristas being met with the ""oh i asked for this in my drink?""  like, no, bethany, you did not. unless if i'm suddenly suffering a stroke or have an undiagnosed memory issue,  then i clearly remember you texting your gc on your phone and barely giving me eye contact. like?  where did common decency go over the pandemic? ?

704,starbucks,"i prefer doing morning shifts because i have the rest of the day open for personal time/school/my second job, but oh my goodness do i hate my coworkers and shift leader. it sucks because the few times i do mid or night it makes me wanna change my availability because of how much i actually enjoy being there, but i can’t because it’ll interfere too much with my busy schedule.

75% of my coworkers i open/morning with dislike me for whatever reason, that’s not the worst of it. to top it all off the main culprit of making my life a walking hell when i’m there is my shift leader, let’s call her r. i have been working for starbucks for a year and a half, i’m a 298 partner and moved to my current store about two months ago. the first few shifts i worked with r was totally fine. i like to talk to my coworkers and get to know everybody and make conversation. she seemed like a nice person. then one day i got food poisoning and had to leave early (i found coverage). she didn’t seem to care at all and while i was in the back resting drinking water almost passed out in pain she kept asking me to come back on the floor and getting annoyed when i told her i physically couldn’t. 

after that, it’s just got worse. any little mistake or anything i do she makes comments on, and she’s even in front of me talked shit to another coworker assuming i didn’t know spanish. now most people in the morning crew hate me. i don’t care, but they’re so snarky about it. they all of a sudden treat me like a new partner even though i’ve been there almost two years. saying shit like “oh would you feel comfortable going on bar later to get in some practice?”. i used to get moved around all positions but for the past few months every shift, and i mean every shift i’ve been put on dtr. not even dto. 

i know it’s not a me problem because every shift at least two customers come to me complaining about how rude r is. and she is! blatantly rude to everyone, especially customers. i’m thinking about quitting even though i like the place, just because morning crew makes it unbearable.",i hate most of my coworkers

ive taken it personally that no one wants to hang out with me. i mean i havent invited anyone to hang but usually they will all be hanging out and i still wont get an invite. would be easier for them to invite me. we all get along.

would love suggestions from you experts! the parameters are below:

- i’m lactose intolerant (so must have oat milk or coconut milk), although whipped cream is ok
- i want a coffee drink
- i typically order flavored lattes because i like sweetened coffee drinks with some milk in them. it doesn’t need to be a latte, but trying to give some context on my tastes
- favorite flavors are chocolate, caramel, and vanilla (combos of any of these or variations are welcome) 
- no pumpkin (food allergy) 
- can be iced/cold or hot
- toppings are welcome if they enhance the drink

710,starbucks,"so the store down the road from us is closed for renovations for 2 months so we got some of their borrowed partners. i came in to fill a shift today and saw 2 people that i had never seen before so i assumed they were borrowed partners (they were). right as i get on the shift one of them is automatically complaining about hating being here and wanting to go home. like?? what. and then she starts to get snippy and have an attitude with us.

at first i thought it was just me but she was being insanely bitchy to our shift lead (whom we all love she's amazing) for no reason. listen, we all know it's against standard to have towels on the counters, but our store does it anyway because it's easier to pick up the mess. we keep them roughly hidden away in corners and also underneath our bars so that we can clean up every once in a while instead of having to run around to find a clean towel. 

she gets all up in our faces and basically snaps at us that it's not standard. and i'm like.. this isn't your damn store. i don't say anything but she's really pissing me off at this point. anyways, so later i was on cold bar and put a towel on our cold bar frap roast pump because idk ab y'all but that shit literally leaks and sprays everywhere. about 10 seconds later i see the same girl had taken the towel off.. like wtf do you think it was there for.

not only did she keep moving shit and complaining about how she hated it here. she was just being snippy and snarky about literally everything and interrupting me while i was helping customers and shit. she even opened a new till on the second register just cuz she ""scanner wasn't working"" without even consulting the shift. like wtf. you can't just do that.

the second girl got all pissy when i told her that we hand out cafe drinks in a specific spot and mobiles in another since we are cafe only.. like dude half the customers couldn't find their drinks bc you put them where they don't go. 

overall i did not have fun with how these girls were acting and parading around like it was their store. i've literally been a borrowed partner for their store and another store i'm transferring to and never act like that. 

to top it all of this girl has been working since february, the same time i started working. where in the hell do you think you have authority over any of us??

i’ve been going to my local since september 2021 since my wife and i started a business together. coffee is essential to our day. we started going to our local dt. we visited nearly every day, and now this year it’s once every other day.

the shift manager, she is an absolute delight! even when there is cars behind us, she always chats to us, goes the extra mile and always makes our day. we always leave saying ‘absolutely love her!’ 

when things have gone wrong with orders, even when we order on uber eats for delivery and it’s wrong. we go and see her, she fixes everything. 

when it’s been busy and we’ve placed a mobile order on the app and go through the drive thru, she comes out, asks what our order was and makes it in advance so it’s quicker for us. 9/10, she’ll upgrade our drinks to large no charge. she’ll give us snacks sometimes too even though we’re always wanting to pay for it!

i just thought of posting my experience here, as i’ve sent an email saying how much she is a credit to the store with no reply, so i wanted to inform other partners on here, that you do makes customers days. you will have the horrid customers, but a smile and chat if you’ve got the time, really does make our day!

i will also note, that the other employees at this store, really do half-ass drinks, and she has to fix them, she is a legend!

when you order ahead via starbucks app, it literally prompts you to ask your barista for your mobile order giving your name when you get to the store. today i had an issue with a customer arguing for the first time working over a year as a barista, i didn’t appreciate it. when you guys walk in the store, we greet you. when you approach us to the handoff plane, we acknowledge you, we give you your mobile order when it’s read when you say something like “hi, i’m here picking up for [insert name].” then we’ll give you your order right away if it’s ready, if your order it’s not ready, we’ll let you know we’re still working on it then we’ll call out your order when it’s ready. but never expect us to call out your drinks when you mobile order. sometimes it might be very busy with lots of drinks to make where we wouldn’t notice anyone coming in, you just sit at the lobby thinking we would call out your drink like we call out in-store orders, then you complain you been waiting for 30 minutes for your order when you was supposed to let us know you’re here for your mobile order. generally, we call out in-store orders, and we put mobile orders to a space where we store mobile orders until customers come pick up their mobile order. it’s funny how customers that order in store, stare at me making their drinks while customers that mobile order just come and sit at the lobby thinking we would call out their order. fortunately it doesn’t happen too often.",we don’t always call out mobile orders

761,starbucks,"sorry if this is the wrong sub.

i (mtf 20) decided not to work at starbuck's after six days of training. i kind of regret it because i think it could've gone easier with time, but i also was feeling really overwhelmed. 

on half of the days of my training, i didn't have a lot of guidance because we were understaffed. i was working the register on my own on day four. i have a lot of anxiety which makes it hard to remember and concentrate under pressure and my coworkers / shift supervisor were critical when i couldn't remember the order of tasks while in each position. they said that they didn't expect me to remember everything but after a day or two it felt like they did.

however, i think a big part of my experience might've just been me interpreting things in a negative way. i have low self-esteem and now i'm thinking i should've just stayed and toughed it out, and that it would've gotten easier. but i don't think that after telling the store manager that i couldn't handle the job based on six days of training (four hours each) she will be thrilled to take me back after just two days of reflection. i also would feel a little embarrassed even if they did take me back, considering that we didn't even get to me learning how to make drinks.

it also was difficult because everyone there ignored my pronoun pin (meaning they gendered me incorrectly), but i didn't specifically introduce myself with pronouns so i guess that's not really anyone's fault?

should i just move on and try to get a job somewhere else, and then just come back after a year or two and advocate for myself citing personal growth and job experience? i think that this job might be very important to me in the future as a source of health benefits.

tl;dr impulsively quit during training and now regretting it.",mtf 20 got myself into a stupid situation as prospecting barista. how likely is it i will be rehired?

779,starbucks,"i am a green bean still learning and while i’ve learned a lot, there are times i’ve made mistakes. i got my first karen yesterday and the experience just sucked the absolute life out of me. it was my mistake and i profusely apologize but she kept calling me a horrible and terrible person. 

what happened was we had one last chocolate cake pop left but i forgot that this other mom asked for it. so when the karen came up to my till and asked for it, i told her that we had one left and she was all happy for it. then i realized the cake pop was for the other mom and i told her. her mood shifted so quick and she just started to get all angry. she ended up calling me a terrible person for not speaking up for myself and this just continued for a couple of minutes. when she asked for the cookies and cream cake pop, i told her that we were all out, which made the situation worse. she proceeds to call my store the worst store and says, “this is so hard on the little ones!” i’m not entirely sure what she meant but i continued to smile and apologize. 

my hands were shaking but regardless of her words, i gave her two unicorn cake pops. i could tell that she saw me do it cus her body language was the tiniest bit looser than when she was calling me these names. after giving her the items, she grabbed her son and walked out. i started to tear up a bit and i didn’t know what to do. so i just helped out the next customer through a couple of tears and a shaky voice. 

my partners are super supportive but i didn’t want them to feel the weight of the situation so i just kept it to myself. it took me a couple of minutes to get over it, but as i began to help other customers, the thought dawned on me. for every 10,000 customers you help, you will always get a handful of karens. and that sucks. but a few horrible interactions can never ruin the amazing experiences of seeing someone’s face when you remember their name and their regular order.",karens

is it normal to be scheduled outside of your availability to “meet the need of the store”?

is it normal to not trust the schedule because everyday there seems to be a rewrite?

is it normal to have your manager have shifts rewrite several weeks worth of scheduling?

these are a list of questions i’ve been thinking of for the passed couple of days. the store i work at feels like a complete mess and i wanted to know what normal was? i always read about shitty customers, but yet the customers are actually my favorite part about my job.

here come bunch of teens ordering what looked like mostly frap. 3 girl teens (i am guessing age 16 or 17) get their drink and sit down near me. i am not really paying attention to them except that i notice how much make up they got on them and then after 3-5 minutes i am hearing sound of splash and a laugh, one of them drop her drink. they all start laughing with one saying, “oh you did it again”. now i am fully paying attention to them, girl gets up and walks over to handout and says in most sarcastic voice, “i am sorry i dropped my drink”. if look could kill, she would already be dead, as barista gave her the angriest look i ever seen before saying “why do you always drop your drink on purpose?” barista points at the wet floor signs nearby and tells her to put it near the spill and that someone else will come soon to clean it up. keep in mind lobby is extremely busy and looks like they are barely able to keep up, drive thru is so busy that cars are backing up on to the street, after 3-5 minutes here comes barista with mop bucket/mop. 

she comes to them and says clean it up yourself i am tired of dealing with your mess or i am going to ban all of you forever. girl that dropped her drink is no longer laughing and instead is now totally red. the other 2 still giggling thinking it’s all a joke. barista goes back behind the counter leaving mop/mop bucket next to the girls. 1 min goes by, and i am thinking they are going to leave and not clean up the mess, finally after few minutes the girl gets up, wrings out the mop and start mopping. took her few minutes to clean up as she did have to rinse out the mop few times. it looked like she did a good job cleaning up. she takes mop back and they give her replacement frap. barista also said, “you drop it again and i am making you mop the lobby completely” in loud enough voice that i think everyone in the lobby was able to hear it. they left soon after that. few others got kicked out for being extremely loud. 

tl:dr girl (teen) dropped her drink and it wasn’t the first time apparently. barista handed her a mop and made her mop it up herself or she was going to get banned as well as her group. few others got kicked out for being extremely loud.",teens and starbucks

i recall starbucks receipts having the bathroom code and that made sense to me, but now people have to ask us for the code.

about 50 times a day i'm asked whats the code. what's worst is when non customers think they can just drop some logs off for free.

sometimes it's hard to know who is a customer because sometimes i'm in office. 

i thought of giving customers a receipt and writing the code down. this seems to work, but when it gets busy the baristas just don't have time to check if a person is a customer or not.

839,starbucks,"i have been working at my current store for about 8 months now, working for the company for a year &amp; a half. at my last store, i met an incredible shift supervisor that eventually got her own store as a manager &amp; has been waiting for me to work for her. she’s awesome and i thrive in her environment/working style. 

at the same time she got her store, i was being transferred for another reason (nothing negative), so i couldn’t go to the store i wanted. my stores management is too micromanaging, all that matters is drive thru times. i once spilled hot coffee on myself, at like 5am,  and no one cared if i was okay, they just took me off drive bar bc times were more important. unless i’m working a closing shift, the environment feels too hostile and high strung.
 anyway, i waited a few months before requesting to go to the store i prefer. my current sm said no because we were understaffed. understandable. a few weeks later we got about 6 new hires. i waited for them to finish training &amp; get used to the store. when i asked again, my sm complained that i was late too many times. clocking into my shifts way too late (when i was about a minute past my shift only twice, &amp; another time i was 27 minutes late because of car problems) she said she couldn’t be like “oh yeah here you can have her at your store with all her problems” i was so shocked i didn’t even respond to that. i’m a good worker, i just want to be at a store where the manager actually likes me and respects me as a human being, not just another body to help get the drive thru times down. 
anyway i’ve been insanely on top of my attendance, picking up shifts and being as helpful as possible so she can transfer me. my family and my boyfriends whole family have been telling me to contact her boss, because there’s no reason she can’t just transfers me especially if i’m unhappy at this store. what do you guys think?",why won’t i get transferred?

i know it's the schtick to give me a silly name, and i know that it probably wasn't meant to be anything mean, but i can't get it out of my head. i'm fat, i know i am, the last few years have been rough and it's messed up my recovery badly. i really don't want to tell my friend because i am embarrassed to admit that i am bulimic, but it's making me not want to go back to the store. i don't know what to do, do i try to speak to the girl to ask why she put belly? it's not a name!! it just feels really humiliating","the name thing, please help"
865,starbucks,"not really sure how i feel.

apparently they've sent eachother links to my page and talk about what i post. i always worked fine with them, and it was strange they wouldn't just follow me if they were going to go through my uploads.

i don't really know what it is they talk about, and part of me isn't sure i want to know. it's public though so i guess i can't be mad, but it does feel uncomfortable.

why am i being mentioned in the group chat? how were you able to notice i deleted a story? apparently it's something they talked about in the chat, that they were all talking about it.

i want to ask but i know it wouldn't make a difference. the person who told me kind of let it slip, and now i'm replaying and overthinking everything she said and all of her body language.

sorry this isn't that relevant to starbucks. i just needed to get this off my chest.

that said, it's probably just me being insecure. if they were talking mad shit about me, i doubt the girl would have told me. i don't know her well but i know she's always been consistently nice to me and others. i post my art on my instagram so maybe that's the reason",found out 5 coworkers text about my instagram

i understand that the coffee flavour comes from the “frappuccino roast,” so just making a regular coffee frap decaf isn’t possible, right?

my thought was to get some sort of crème frap and add a shot of decaf espresso. if we went that route, what crème frap would y’all recommend?

884,starbucks,"i hate my job, the customers, and the employees especially. we had a line today with each people at one station. when i’m done charging the people at the window and i’m still waiting for the bar to finish drinks or warmers to get warming, i’ll either assist them or something (i don’t like talking to the customers because they don’t wear masks and i really hate seeing their teeth and eyes wander when they talk). rather than my asshole coworkers thanking me for assisting them to get the times down, they try chastise me for being the cause of the problem lol because when i’m getting warming, the annoying barista finally finishes her last drink for me and say “coke one let’s get the times down”. ummm bitch, it’s on you guys. just calm down. we aren’t fucking robots. so instead of chastising them back, i just say “oh” because i’m a tall black man working there with little teens that aren’t black and automatically watch whatever i do, just to feel the small rush of telling someone what to do. if i yell at them or talk harshly, they get scared or whisper about me. 
i got back on my break and this employee that’s gunning for a manger position pulled me aside and asked what i can do for the times to go down… i said “🤨i don’t control the physical pace of the employees”. he said “you need to be more accustomed to communication over the headset” i replied back with “talking doesn’t increase the pace of people, okay?”

888,starbucks,"let's be honest here; starbucks is a mess right now.

from my time working there, and my time recently put, i thought about my experience and the company and wanted to put it here for anyone to read. barista or guest.

here are my observations:

1 - the baristas work so hard for so little pay. just after ordering 3 items, you have already spent what would be an hour made for a barista. imagine the total of orders baristas make in an hour.

2 - the company's response to the unionizing is serious to their reputation and is only adding coal to a fire. if the trend continues, we might see a complete collapse of our brand.

3 - there is a fight between quality of transaction and quantity of transaction. we are mandated to meet ""customer connection"" but under a 30 second time frame to keep up with orders. starbucks needs to pick one or the other and stop stressing our baristas out.

these are just some of my major concerns of the company. it would be nice to hear your thoughts.",the company is a mess
889,starbucks,"this drives me nuts.
  

i had to tell someone six times today and finally just defaulted to asking if the screen is correct.

why is it so hard for the driver to say the order or repeat it?

it also always seems to be the femme presenting passenger yelling across the masc driver**. i just want to tell them that they definitely aren't too manly to order at starbucks.

(** i tried to think the most inclusive description for the scenario we've all seen)","""i'm so sorry. i can't hear you from the passenger seat"""
890,starbucks,"so, i’m a new ssv, haven’t even completed half of my modules. i was shown cash management, a few counts, the pastry pull, and how to run breaks. luckily, i was being helped along this summer to be the new ssv so i had done the pulls and helped run breaks. last night was my very first shift as ssv despite not having much training at all. 

i worked really hard and was happy to leave everything looking stocked and great. the baristas seemed happy with it. i took my time on all my shift tasks. the tills were counted, safe was counted, deposit with slip submitted, alarm on, doors locked…

i get a text this morning from the opening shift saying that 2/3 tills were fine and the safe was fine too. but the third cash was short -$80… i said that there was no way. i was very thorough. it is possible that i miscounted but $80 worth? no way.

so i even went in to talk to the ssv who verified that the safe was fine but the till was still short -$80. i’m really upset with this as i was meticulous on my close. i’ve contacted my manager about it and will talk to them tomorrow. i’m hoping that it was somehow put in the deposit bag but to me it seems unlikely! i even went back into the store to check all of the pockets of our dirty aprons!

does anyone know what the next steps are and what the likely scenario is? i clearly know how to balance a cash because the other two were fine so i just cannot imagine what happened to this till! :(",new ssv
891,starbucks,"sometimes the way people order food doesn’t match up with how workers are trained to take orders. a good example of this is when i go to tim hortons and order a bagel belt. belt stands for bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato. i don’t like bacon and i love veggies so i would always order a bagel belt with no meat please. the response was always, “so just egg and cheese?” at which point i would say, “i mean i want the vegetables too” then i would get what i want. but then the next time when asked, “so just egg and cheese?” i would respond yup, and i’d get a bagel with just egg and cheese, no veggies. so then my next visit i’d ask for a bagel belt and no bacon, but please leave the veggies on. this would confuse the worker and i’d have to explain that i want the egg cheese, lettuce tomato but no bacon. this became very frustrating because i knew there was a way to properly order without confusion. i finally found out what that magic combination of words is, egg belt. i say “i’d like an egg belt.” no more confusion.

i have a similar problem at starbucks. i want a cold sugar free drink. i do not want sugar free syrup. i simply want that sugar is not added to my drink. i like the passion tea. if i order passion tea. it comes hot. if i order a cold passion tea it comes with some sugar added and i’m always asked if i’d like to add lemonade. then they always confirm that i want it “with water”. this i frustrating because in my world tea is automatically served with water. so after much discussion i got a passion tea, with water and ice. no sugar, no additives no lemonade. good, i thought i understood. but i just ordered a cold passion tea. i said, please no sugar. after assuring them that i did not want lemonade, i do want water, i paid for my drink and left. but i just took a sip and it’s for sure sweet. so i got tea, ice, water and some sort of syrup but i’m not sure what.

898,starbucks,so i ordered a drink and the person asked me what size? so i said large. the person repeated what size? so i said oh yeah grande. we all know grande means large so why cant the employee take large as an answer by way of understanding that the customer wants the big size known as grande? im sure some employees are annoyed they cant take large as answer. and why cant customers say large? its like the words small medium and large dont exist in starbucks world,drink sizes
899,starbucks,"so i started at the end of february of this year, just after my store reopened with full hours (major staff shortage before i came). i was hired by a temporary sm from another store, and got a coffee tasting and an apron, whatever….

and in the true spirit of starbucks, i showed up at 8:30 am on sunday for my first shift. i was told to do all the modules in mylearning… which i did for four hours straight, on my own, until my ssv told me my shift was done. no trainer, no questions, no nothing—i came back, and for the next two weeks, would be asked to do something, ask how to do it, and get dropped off into whatever it was, told to let them know if i had any questions. :)))

i had a total of 1 hour explanation about how to make drinks (plus some of the barista basics) and uhhh that was it. i’m now routinely on dt, dishes, and the dreaded front/warming sunday morning combo. i’ve been put on bar more and more, have full-on broken down once because i didn’t know how to do anything during peak… but i’m in this weird limbo now where our 20+ brand new partners have literally 4 times the training i do.

- you need to find someone to cover your shift. ✖️

i witnessed something *that truly doesn’t surprise me* because, some ( i said some not all ) of these customers are absolutely fucking scum humans. 

this lady, late 20s - early 30s orders a drink in the cafe at the register. and of courseeeeee to no surprise “ it’s wrong” okay coolio. there’s a right way, and a wrong way to handle this situation as a customer. 

but nooooooo this bitch without skipping a beat, walks up to the poor little kid on pos and rips him a new ass about how he made the drink wrong. he is literally not making the drinks he is on register. she’s swearing, waving her hands everywhere, clicking her nails in his face “ every time i come here yall don’t fucking listen i said - blah blah.” 

i didn’t want to intervene because clearly there were competence issues in her department. i’m next in line i politely order my drink, i tipped the kid $20 , apologized on her behalf , and told the kid not to put the tip in the jar , and to pocket that shit! 

tldr: some of you customers are fucking gross and outrageous. reality check who fucking raised you?! it’s embarrassing having people like you exist on the same planet. be a decent fucking human, stop taking your bad days out on service workers.

933,starbucks,"people who order light ice (especially through the drive through with having to constantly hear them chime in “oh and can i get that with light ice”) are usually just a small pet peeve of mine and tbf i usually do not mind and will regularly give people light ice and fill their drinks above the third line anyways. however. today, combined with how much of a mess our pos was, really made me grow a special immense dislike for people who are insistent on getting light ice.

1. getting light ice is not a “sneaky hack” to get more drink. if your barista is making your drink correctly, there would still be the same amount of drink. if you are still getting your drinks filled to the top, be grateful that you have a nice barista.

just today, i had two people in drive complain about their drink not being light ice. this one girl, who came back through the drive through twenty minutes after her initial order, apparently had “only realized that she had ordered light ice after she finished the drink”. like i cannot even lie. when she told me this at the window, i was literally speechless. she was pointing at this completely empty venti cup with only ice left in it (and not even that much, probably less than the standard amt) telling me that she had wanted it with light ice and wanted us to remake it. she also told me her impossible sandwich was over cooked, rubbery, and she wanted us to remake that as well. 

the second case was about this lady who ordered two paradise drinks. i hand one out to her. she asks me, “is this light ice?” i tell her yes. she looks at me, shakes her head, and says “this isn’t light ice.” i remake it for her except she was rude to me so there’s a little bit of room at the top. i hand it out with the other one (which literally had like an inch of ice. like this was such light ice. didn’t even reach the third line) and she goes “are you serious? you can’t hand people drinks like this. get me your manager.” and this lady was my last customer before i clocked out of a 5 hour shift where i was only on dto. 

be nice to your baristas. outside of standard company practices and doing our job, we aren’t obligated to go above and beyond for you especially if you’re rude to us.

the way my shift lead (who at the time of the two instances had only been on the floor for like an hour or so and i was the partner who had been there the longest so far after the openers had left!!) handled these two events, the pos problems, and me (the only partner that was actually having to deal w the pos issues on solo drive) was unsupportive and plain mean. don’t snap at me and take your frustration of the day out on me when i’ve literally been here longer than you. support your baristas when they’re dealing with a rude customer and don’t make it seem like it’s their fault for inconveniencing and turning the customer interaction that way.",venti vent about light ice

you are a customer. you are not my supervisor. do not tell me ""can you actually deal with real customers rather than waste my time on these silly deliveries."" 
no. making drinks for those who prefer to order through a delivery service is part of my job and they're as valid a customer as you are. if i continue to pull in store customers drinks forward, then the delivery drivers will be kept waiting and will likely be complained at by the recipient of the delivery drinks.

i'm on my break after a busy morning so this probably isn't worded properly but hearing a mother say to her kid 'these are delivery frappuccinos. the staff don't know how to prioritize their customers.' and being told to ""serve real customers first!"" when my supervisor told me to focus on the many deliveries we had - it's just extra stress.

you don't like the extra wait? i'm not keen on extra workload whilst remaining on £9.50 per hour. you get to go out in the sun with your frappuccinos in less than 3 minutes. i have to stand here all day making more drinks. have a little patience.

we aren’t scheduled enough people on the floor. if we have even one call out (which 2+ is common because we are all so burnt out) we’re absolutely screwed. 3 people on the floor (4 if we’re lucky) during peak and then we’re yelled at about slow dt times and csr cards not being completed. one person making drinks for mobile, dt, and cafe orders because our manager refuses to turn off mobiles most days. we’re the busiest store near us and the burn out is real. 

our store is in the process of unionizing but nothing is finalized yet. about half our partners are ready to walk out (since we’re in an area where walkouts have been happening recently) and we’ve had 5 partners quit or who are in the process of quitting in the next 2 weeks. one of those partners has been with the company for years and is so tired of it. 

i work mornings and i’m exhausted. i dread going to work, i sob in the bathrooms/in my car on breaks, and my mental health (which has been suffering due to personal reasons the past 6 months) is getting so much worse. i’m having migraines most days, throwing up from stress and anxiety from the thought of going to work, and when i’m not working i can’t get out of bed. i’m scared to call out because my manager can be temperamental with call outs. i was scheduled a pdc with my manager over a month ago where i was going to bring up
these concerns and she told me we were too busy and understaffed to have it that day and she’ll reschedule it. that hasn’t happened and i don’t feel comfortable trying to ask again as all my attempts have been shut down. our dm is on our backs just as much about every little detail when we’re already super understaffed so i don’t feel comfortable going there either.

fast-foward to 2022, the job market has been pretty tight and i just can't seem to land any interviews. i saw a job posting for starbucks and fortunately i am now scheduled for a phone interview. 


so a little about me... i used to manage an artisanal coffee shop for about 4.5 years. obviously i don't manage anymore, because the owner decided to move on from the business. we had a kitchen... so including the kitchen staff, we had around 12-14 staff members. we served alcohol, brunch, held private events, etc. once a year, staff and i would participate in a local coffee festival, we get to do free pour latte art all day, so that was fun.


some of our ""main"" gears at the store were:
- kees van der western spirit espresso machine
- mazzer super jolly grinder x 3 (2 on rotation, 1 decaf)
- acaia digital scale x 2 (for dry weight)
- acaia luna espresso scale x 2 (for wet weight)
- poursteady pourover machine

in terms of coffee quality assurance:
- tds drip twice a day (done on the first batch)
- tds pourover that's on current rotation twice a day (this was so annoying lol)
- grind adjustment twice a day (dry weight vs wet weight, pull time)
- taste check espresso, drip, pourover to make sure it's within roasters' taste profile

in terms of management duties, the usual stuff... product roadmap (we launched our own coldbrew, gelato &amp; vegan icecream...) scheduling, answering daily emails, dealing with daily unexpected issues, balancing store rent/labor/other profit margins, running to the bank, weekly planning with our baker and kitchen staff, communicating with our accountant, trying to find new roasters that may fit with our customer's tastebuds, staff training, bi-weekly order (beans, fresh ingredients, alcohol, etc, etc).

also, while we're on the topic of long wait times, please don't leave your kids in the car when you come in to pick up your drink. this may sound obvious but i had 3 different women in 1 week tell me i needed to hurry up and make their drink bc they left their kids in the car in the middle of summer.",drive thru is not the enemy

i know i like a drink that is very uncommon here at the bux, but this goes for every single drink. if you’re unsure, take a moment and look at the recipe card. customers will appreciate a drink that’s made right and might take an extra minute rather than something that was rushed and doesn’t taste like what they wanted at all.

1068,starbucks,"i left the company last november and took a well-needed mental break. i was a ssv when i left, so when i decided to return to the company, i applied for a ssv position. because of the raise that they gave everyone, it's the most money i'll ever have made.  

anyways, long story short, i applied and got hired at a new store, and now i'm second guessing everything and kind of wish i just applied as barista first. 

i have to go through all of the training again, it feels really odd having someone who worked for the company less than i have ""train"" me, but i understand it's just the way it is.
 
my new store seems very clique-y and everyone has very strong personalities. 

im very reserved and shy and it's started to make me anxious how everyone there seems to behave. 

my friend works at a different store that is closer to where i live and i had originally wanted to apply to, the only reason i hadn't was because they weren't in need of supervisors, however now at this point i'm very stressed with becoming the supervisor of a store and a team i don't know, i'm kind of wondering if there's a chance i can reach out to my friend's store and see if i can stop my ssv training and transfer to that store as just a barista, and then eventually a ssv.

i'm just too worried to talk to anybody about this, i don't want my new sm thinking i'm trying to bail, or not ready to become a ssv, because i'm not really sure what i want to do yet. i was hired on as a ssv and that's currently what i am in the system, so i don't want to make everything difficult. 

the pay is also really good and what brought me back, and so i'm not sure if i want to step down and make barista pay. 

has anyone ever had to supervise a store and a team that they didn't know? were you as stressed and worried as i feel about it? i'm not sure if i'm just psyching myself out and once i'm used to the store and new team it'll be fine, or if i really should talk to my sm about transferring as just a barista to a different store.",i'm returning as a ssv and i'm second guessing everything

to make a long story short i sent in a transfer request form to my manager several weeks ago pertaining to a location at my desired city. after a successful interview with said store and finding an apartment all in one week, i just hear that i might not be able to transfer just yet. 
to put in perspective, i interviewed for the store that i sent in a request for, as a result, i got accepted at a different store in the same area. 

we talked about first dates and everything and i thought it was handled, and i didn’t have to worry about much else other than driving for the move. my manager tells me that she hasn’t gotten anything from me, and that i need to send in a new transfer for the new store, and that it might take anywhere from a week to six months to transfer….

ive talked with the other manager that accepted me and she said her and her dm would be on top of accepting that transfer form from my district asap. but i’m really worried that i might not transfer in time, especially after i found a place..

all this to say, i've noticed that in the past 2 months when i order vsccb (both at the register and app) it's never what i remember it being. sometimes it is super dark and clearly has very little creamer. others comes with the thinnest layer of cold foam that looks like it deflated in the bottom of the blender for a while.
i've had problems before and remedied them by asking for extra sweet cream or extra cold foam. then a barista suggested i try my tall drink in a grande cup so that they can actually put the extra cream and foam. this worked great for a while too. 
now though, the drink is consistently inconsistent. the other day i had a straight cold brew with cold foam handed to me. no vanilla, no sweet cream. i felt terrible asking if they forgot the cream and the girl at the bar looked back at the other barista to ask and she just said ""i don't think so"". that was the second store i went to that day (truly just because i hate being that person who is super picky and demands a remade drink). 
i live in a college town, so during the school year i don't even think twice, y'all are busy. but it's much quieter over summer and my drink rarely takes more than 5 minutes. are the additions of extra foam or sweet cream or the grande sized cup annoying the baristas (i always worry they annoyingly roll their eyes when my order comes up since my name is uncommon)

1087,starbucks,"so i dont really use reddit a lot, but i just kind of need a place to vent about this. i think this is called a venti rant? i'm not super well versed with the lingo. 

i've been working at this store for a few months now, and everything's been going okay so far, but there's this one supervisor who seems to always be looking for things to correct people on. i understand that we have a standard to follow, but sometimes the things she's correcting us on go against what i've been taught or what other people tell me. i still try my best, but all of the corrections tend to stress me out and ironically, i do a worse job when she's leading because i'm so worried about all the little things that she's corrected me on that i mess up basic things on accident. 

today, i was already having kind of a rough day, but for the last hour and a half of my shift, i was put on customer support. 

i'll be the first to tell anyone that customer support isn't my strong suit. most of the time when i'm put on it, it's when we're slammed and i'm running all over the place, so i usually just kind of do whatever's needed of me at the moment, and never learned the customer support cycle. i rely on this piece of paper that's taped up near the task list that lists the cycle.

i was kind of frazzled, but i tried to do the cycle as best as i could. i brewed coffee, and then made sure the lobby was clean (this is what the paper says is a part of the customer support cycle. i don't know if i misread it or if it's outdated or what), but while i was looking at what to do next, i saw a partner had a lot of cards they had to complete, and i wanted to step in and help.

this was my bad, i'll admit it, i should have completed the cycle first. but when i went to go help, the supervisor asked me where i was on the cycle and i froze. i tried to explain what i had done and what i was doing, and she said i was doing it wrong listed off a whole different order for the customer support cycle than what was on the paper. i felt kind of stupid for that.

she lectured me pretty hard. i didn't know how to explain anything, so i just stood there. she has this way of correcting people that makes it sound like she's upset with you for not knowing such a simple thing. i felt embarassed, considering i wasnt doing a good job at cs at all. then she had me do a trash run. 

i started crying during my trash run and couldn't stop. i guess it was the stress of that day, being told i was doing everything wrong, being put in the position im the worst at, all of that just kind of culminated. it didn't help that someone accidentally closed the back door while i was running the trash, and i had to walk through the front door. one partner noticed me crying and offered to cover for me while i went to the bathroom, which was very nice of them but i'm absolutely mortified that i was caught crying at all, especially over something like that.

i don't know what to do. i'm going to be transferring to another store soon (unrelated to this whole mess), so i can only hope that i won't have another shift with her, but if by some stroke of bad luck i do have to work with her again, i don't know if i'll be able to do any sort of job without thinking about how hard i cried. i try not to let things get to me, but this is the first time i've actually cried at work in my almost 2 years of being with this company.",my supervisor made me cry
1088,starbucks,my question being is do you see a lot of ssv burn out in your stores. i worked in a metro area with high volume. but yeah when i became a ssv i came to realize a lot of the shifts in my store / district were not happy with their jobs. also a lot of them weren’t trying to become asm either.,discussion: ssv burn out
1089,starbucks,"my current store closes at 7, which some people seem to have a lot of trouble grasping. literally every night we close at least one customer comes up and tries to pull on the doors, often more than that though. the funniest is that sometimes they will try one door (we have a patio entrance and a front entrance) and when it doesn't open walk around to the other and try it. 
often when someone is doing this i try to signal through the windows we are closed. i'll make an x with my arms, or point at the hours sign next to the door. usually helps them understand lol, plus it feels super weird to just act like i don't see them. 
well tonight a group of like four people (a family it looked like) were trying to get in, and did the two door thing. when i made eye contact with the woman i did my hands crossed thing, and she got it. but one of the guys she was with was still confused, so i did it again, and he looked kinda bummed. so i did a tear gesture, like how a mime might do. the group walked off down the street, and i was chatting with my barista about it and realized that my little tear may have come off as rude.

he proceeds to say, ""just get me a new lid. can't you see what's wrong with this one?"" (his drink had a tiny bit of vsccf spilling from the nitro sip hole.)

at this point, i'm exhausted, i'm working with a migraine and as always understaffed. i snapped. i grab him a new nitro lid, fix his drink for him, and hand it to him. 

then i say, ""i don't appreciate the way you speak to me."" 

his jaw dropped. he just asks, ""what?""

""i don't appreciate you speaking to me like i'm stupid.""

shame on starbucks corporate for allowing and encouraging customers to verbally abuse baristas, making the job harder and harder every day, expanding the menu endlessly, giving us shitty training resources, taking away benefits for trans partners, illegally union busting, and paying most people a wage that doesn't even cover living expenses. you should all be embarrassed even though none of you are self aware, and you all sit in your corporate offices making so much money off of the hard work of baristas while you make decisions that make our lives so much harder and you do absolutely nothing. you're the real problem.",venti rant

1160,starbucks,"where i live it’s going to be very fall-like (low temp of 55!!) and i’m wondering what drink i could order right now to help set the tone!

i’m open to any type of drink :) 

thank you!",best “fall-y” drink?
1161,starbucks,"let me start out by saying i [f] have worked in the service industry so i understand the frustration when customers flirt with you when you don’t want them to… this is why i come to you guys for advice. 

anyways, i can not tell if this barista likes me. a little back story i came home from uni and went to my local starbucks to be greeted with a “ wow you’re back?? we’re you at school?” this barista noticed i was gone for a year at uni!! i didn’t even know who he was. we talked for a minute, but i let him get back to his job. 
i start coming in … more frequently to the store and we always make small talk ( him initiating ) and it’s cute, casual, fun. 
fast forward a month, im in the drive through with my dog and i see him leaving. he runs over and is like doggggg then is like oh hey it’s you and i’m like haha hi and he’s like what’s his ( my dogs ) name? for sake of my anonymity i won’t give his specific name but i say something along the lines of “ sugar “ and he responds with hahahha you can call me sugar anyday!! at this point i’m flustered bc that was smooth!! he pets my dog and leaves… it’s whatever. his co-worker working the drive through tells me today was his last day at this location and he would be transferring to another in my city. 
naturally, i go to the new location and when i walk in he shouts across the store “ hey its you!!! how are you!!! “ and i’m flustered !! i wave then go up to order and he shouts “ haha i made her blush “ then my whole face goes red. he’s making my drink and asking me what i’m up to i tell him i’ll be out of town for a little and he tells me i need to come see him before i leave to go back to school. 

i’m now back in town. i’ve been back to the starbucks twice and today was the first day i saw him. i walk in and he’s like “ i like the fit it looks really good on you “ at this point im thinking wowwww dude has a massive crush on me, right?!? i’m sitting there working on my laptop and this girl comes in and starts chatting him up and he’s pretty friendly to her … but not in the same way he’s friendly to me. 

is it possible he is interested or am i reading too much into the situation? maybe he is just a flirt or super personable? i’m asking because i’m not sure if i should try to further this or if that would make him uncomfortable … please help",is he interested?
1162,starbucks,"for context, i’m also a closer myself, but i feel like every single closer at my sbux is lazy. right now it’s just me and this other girl who closes, because everyone else left (most of our workers are university students, myself included). we’re a licensed store so it doesn’t get too busy to the point where we would need more than 2 people after 3 pm. 

the issue i have is that every closer except for me and another guy who left, are lazy. every time we close, i’m the one who has to pick up slack. the other closers always want to close super early, but we aren’t even allowed to close early lmao. the earliest we can leave is 8, since we close at 8. but it doesn’t make sense to mop, shut down espresso machines, etc at 5. now we’re sitting ducks for 3 hours. 

adding onto the fact that apparently before i got here, they always had mandatory meetings because the closers weren’t doing their jobs. i didn’t even wanna be a closer, i got thrown into it because there were too many morning and mid shifters already.

i don’t wanna be one of those snitch coworkers, but atp i’m kinda just at the end of my rope. my last day (until winter and summer break) isn’t for another month, so wtf should i do?",does anyone else’s store have lazy closers?

1167,starbucks,"so, here is a story all about how my life got flipped-turned upside down. sometime in the spring of 2022 a mentally unstable woman that happened to transfer to be a manager at my starbucks decided to make everyone’s life hell on earth. she seemed like the type to unload her stress on others. however, she was cocky and very happy looking when it was convenient for her. she is easily one of the worst people i’ve ever had the displeasure of meeting. the only thing i learned from her was to not use heavy amounts of drugs or i would end up looking like her. prior to her managing this starbucks i only had encountered her once and she smelled as though she had just been pulled out of a heavily used sewer pipe. otherwise known as hot garbage. that should have been a warning to me immediately. i should’ve know that her future actions would be the equivalent of her scent that day. i personally believe that the only reason she was promoted to our starbucks was so that they wouldn’t have to smell or look at her anymore. i am 98.9 percent certain that she has a small colony of silverfish bugs in that thing she calls her hair. oh well, she’s probably one of those ladies who doesn’t believe in grooming or taking the time or effort to be clean. hey, to each their own. shortly after arriving at our store she began to change things that had been running smoothly for some time. schedules were changed and she went on with her life being unconcerned for others or their needs. she didn’t care if it didn’t directly affect her. she would act as though she cared and was able to empathize with others, but in reality she couldn’t. she doesn’t have that part of her brain. classic psychopath. everyone at our store began to complain and miss our old manager because he was just an angel compared to her. he was a solid 12/10 and she was a -6/10. needless to say, she made everyone upset enough to seek work elsewhere and actually leave. she believes that all our employees are required to eat, sleep, and breath starbucks, yet she deleted our means of group communication and forbade us from texting her. she needed her time to decompress and the job she chose wasn’t set up that way. we needed means of communication and she disregarded everyone’s opinion and continued her selfishness. what a luxury to have as a new manager at a starbucks. she even gets to bring her child to work! nobody else gets to do that, but she’s a special gal. i guess when your boss is aware that your life is a mess and your situation is just so awful you’re allowed to do anything you please. she looks and acts like a troll. the one with the blue hair except it’s frizzy, faded, extremely damaged, and smells like mold. it’s a trend. imagine a tiny troll looking woman running around acting like she’s working, but in reality she is pretending to work and spends 9 hours decorating her desk area with plastic cubbies and fake succulent plants. how creative of her. her hobbies at work include, but are not limited to: having crying fits, losing her mind over minutest things, stepping out to her car 26 times a day to smoke who knows what, and sitting at a table for hours. it’s a sight to see. so, to end this story, troll woman let me go for being 2.5, i repeat 2.5, minutes tardy. i rushed to that starbucks through some serious traffic that day. i figure that the amount of resentment and jealousy she harbored towards me was just too much for her to handle. it was so evident the moment she let me go. i thought of all the moments she had done wrong and had no repercussions. making schedules inaccurately, changing schedules last minute, stepping to her vehicle 26 times a day, being rude and unprofessional towards employees, giving employees snide remarks, then just an overall lack of understanding and knowledge on her job title. poor woman. i will always be concerned for her. the type of karma that she will receive will be ugly. it really is sad to watch horrible people continue their worst behavior despite being knowledgeable of their shortcomings. if you’re reading this, please send some love out to this special woman because she needs it. she needs all the help she can get. bless her little heart.",how an awful starbucks manager gets away with ruining lives
1168,starbucks,"the second after you complain about having to make a certain drink or fraps or anything else like that you get a bunch of people saying ""if you don't like it then leave"" or ""i always feel insecure ordering my drink bevause i feel like they're mad at me"" who cares i'm such a silly little goofy varista getting payed 16/hr",tik tok is such a weird place
1169,starbucks,"i had a coworker and a customer lose it on me today because they didn’t know what a espresso macchiato was, and i need to rant. espresso macchiato is shots of espresso “marked” with a dollop of foam. the ratio is half foam and half espresso. if you order an iced espresso macchiato, it is made the exact same way (steamed foam on top of shots) except we pour the espresso over ice. when a customer ordered this today with white mocha, i made what she asked for.","psa: an espresso macchiato is not the same as a caramel macchiato. if you want an iced caramel macchiato with mocha instead of vanilla, ask to substitute the syrup. or get an upside down latte. please do not yell at me when i hand you an iced espresso macchiato w/mocha, when you ordered one!"
1170,starbucks,"i've been a regular at this location for about 6 months now and the shift supervisor is an affable, super professional no-nonsense type guy. he started giving me free drinks a few months back when i'd come in, saying it was on him.

i figured he was just being nice to regulars and i said thanks every time and emailed corporate to praise the staff at the store without mentioning the free drinks.

there was a point when i couldn't come by for a month and a half and when i showed up again he seemed upset. and then he started giving me discounts on my drink. yesterday i went by and he wasn't working, but a barista said to me ""i'm giving you a discount,"" and i asked for a receipt this time because i needed the wifi code that comes with it.

after sitting down i realized the receipt had '30% partner beverage' printed on it, along with the ss's name. that means he's paying what is owed out of his own pocket, right? and he's telling other employees to use his partner beverage on a customer when he's not even on shift?

i feel confused and embarrassed and have no idea how to address it because i feel bad that he's spending his hard-earned money on a customer. 

*this is in a country that doesn't have tipping culture, especially not at starbucks.",flirting or great customer service?
1171,starbucks,"for context, i’ve worked here for over a year and i’ve just transferred cross country; my first day at the new store was uh…something.

for starters, we did our entire peak in a four partner play, which i’ve done before but i was hoping being in a major city might make this less common, though i was mistaken.

naturally we shut off mobiles and uber eats, closed the cafe, all that good stuff. 

then on my ten, i found a bag of crack in the bathroom. just. crack. right there in the bathroom.

later, after mobile orders were off, a lady pulled up in the drive thru, without stopping at the speaker box of course, with a printed out copy of her mobile order. yes, a hard copy of the mobile order with a different address on it. 

she then proceeded to scream at us before realizing the address was down the road, also claiming she thought we were a bbq restaurant???

why are food service people, cleaning mats and bathrooms??? other food service places i used to work at would literally hire someone separately to do this. there are even companies who swap mats on schedules much like cintas with the rags.

i mean seriously. imagine how much easier it would be to just clean things needed for bar and how much healthier a store would be if someone who just cleaned a bathroom is not on bar immediately after. the most cleaning we should even be doing are dishes.

1213,starbucks,"it's not a big deal because i'm able to cover it with clothing, but i've been a partner for 4 years and recently got a throat tattoo. i know its in the handbook that throat and face tattoos are not allowed. however, anytime anyone inquires about the rules regarding tattoos, everyone i ask tells me they aren't enforced very well and nobody really cares. which i didn't really doubt given that starbucks is quite a progressive and accepting company to work for. i love my tattoo, i have no regrets and maybe i'm selfish but i'm not really willing to deny myself the type of self expression that makes me feel the most myself for the sake of a job. i was sent home today because i don't have anything to cover it yet, but i'll be going out today to find something nice to wear to make sure it isn't visible. 

i'm asking because i genuinely don't get it- what makes neck tattoos acceptable but throat tattoos unacceptable? i suppose i was under the assumption that ""throat tattoos"" in the handbook referred to ""neck tattoos"" as well, and just like how we weren't allowed to have hand tattoos years ago, i assumed perhaps the rules regarding neck/throat tattoos were moving in a similar direction. it's very confusing. what makes throat tattoos specifically controversial?",so we can have neck tattoos but not throat tattoos?

1227,starbucks,"so i was on solo drive yesterday during peak and had a customer come through asking for a decaf caramel frap. i explained that it would be the creme based one but she was very adamant that it needed decaf coffee in it, so i offered to make it with decaf shot in it. this was a ~$40 order, and right before they drive away from the box, they complained about the $1 shot charge on the frap.

so i explained again that they had asked for a decaf frap and didn’t want the creme version so that’s what the drink had to be made as. they blow up saying that they have never been charged that by other stores and i’m wrong for ringing the drink like that and all this other stuff. i tried to apologize that other stores may not have been following policy but there was no other way for me to make this drink. i also told her that the other stores may have just been making her creme versions without clarifying that fact to her.

well i’m a shift, but it wasn’t my shift, so i asked for the shift on duty (a friend of mine) to take over, and this woman ended up calling my friend a bitch!

from some basic research i understand the terraza blend is what the starbucks iced coffee is called, but it's not available for retail sale. so apparently the best recommendation is to use the kenya blend? 

starbucks has a [poorly written recipe on their site](https://www.starbucksathome.com/ca/en-ca/recipes/starbucks-iced-coffee) that doesn't specify amount of ice or change with serving size. they also recommend the breakfast blend roast.

all the intel i'm getting seems to be that the coffee is brewed ""double strength"" and then immediately poured over ice to dilute, essentially making it an american version of the japanese flash brew method... essentially. and then pouring over ice as the non-diluting ice to actually sit in the drink while you drink it.

so if i want to make a single cup (let's say tall size)... what's the best method and roast?

again, i do not like cold brew and i'm not looking for something *better* than starbucks iced coffee... i'd like to achieve the exact same taste at home.

we have caller id and we block the numbers, but they just incessantly call us back using fake google numbers or whatever app that allows them to make up phone numbers. sometimes if they call a whole bunch of times and they have a caller id name i pick up and i go ""hi! *insert caller id name* we keep getting disconnected how can i help you""

it just irks me. this is why i hate being in the service industry anymore because i don't understand why people think it's acceptable to even play a prank call like that on us like we have nothing else better to do. and on top of that to blatantly disrespect us for something that we didn't do. sorry i'm just extremely tired and i feel like it's the cherry on top for my day that i don't need. to be verbally abused by children.

i don’t get why you’d complain about your drink being wrong before even, ya know, trying it?? i know this isn’t the biggest deal, but it makes me question how many times rude customers could be put at ease if they just took a second to use a little more critical thinking… (spoiler, it’s a lot lol)",questioning if people… think?

i get paid the same amount no matter what the customer orders, be it ridiculous or simple, yet i find myself increasingly annoyed and bothered by customer orders that attempt to save money or are complicated.

for example, customers who order shots over ice with milk then ask for even more milk at the handout bar - why not just pay for a latte?
we have a regular who does this every day and i understand trying to save money if you get starbucks once in awhile but if you’re going to do it every day shouldn’t you just buy your own espresso machine and make coffee at home?
or even light ice customers - i understand you want more product but the inconvenience of having to measure differently for things like refreshers bothers me more and more these days. 

i understand and admit that most of our drinks are incredibly overpriced ($5 for a tall pink drink is crazy), and i have empathy for customers who may be financially struggling without a lot of money and just trying to get a treat for themselves or their kids, but then i wonder if the money could be put towards anything more worth it? 

my store also has several regulars who request obnoxious things - for example, we have a customer who comes in 2-4 times per day and each time orders 2 drinks along with 4 venti ice cups, 4+ sleeves, 4+ straws, and he asks to sample the beverage he orders even though it’s the same every day - do these people have any slight hint of environmental awareness?

3) never got my workers comp from my said back injury. the same back injury that i went from 10lb limit and could squat down to a 5lb limit and all i could do was sit and stand and take orders that way.

there are a plethora of other things that it can go into other then just wage too. it could go into more labor, more training, a safety net for fallout, more indirect benefits, etc. 

the thing though, is that howie himself has the most sbux shares out of any single person on the planet so stock buybacks help him more then anyone else as all stock buybacks do is artificially increase demand which drives up the share price.

order: ""hi, can i get a grande coffee frappucino? instead of the three pumps of frappucino coffee base, could i only get one pump of it? i'd still like the three pumps of frapp roast, but only one of the syrup coffee base.""

literally had a barista throw a fit today because she swore she put only one pump of it in when the frappucino was clearly made like standard. as a fellow partner it hurt to complain but it was blatantly obvious it was made wrong

for non-baristas, the frappucino coffee base is added at the end so the frappucino blends nicely and is liquidy and sweet. i like mine icy and not so sweet, so i only ask for one. is this order really that hard to understand? currently trying to find a simpler go to drink lol",baristas can never get my drink right

1326,starbucks,"so for context i’ve worked at starbucks for about 5 months. i transferred to a new store in another state about 2 weeks ago. things are very different from my last store. rules are stricter. i use to be able to wear black leggings and now i can’t. hats are also required. i can’t use another persons till for one transaction, i was told i’d get fired today if i did. i know this is the dress code and these are the rules, i’m not complaining i’m just showing examples of how things are different. i knew it wouldn’t be the same but it just feels like a whole different job. it’s been difficult adjusting to all these different rules, people, routines, and things being done so differently. 
sorry for the rant. anyways, here’s the thing. i have no problem following the new way of things, i just need time to learn. but here’s the thing that is really upsetting me. i loved my job before transferring and now i want to quit. i’ve been working at this new location for 2 weeks now. i usually work shorter 5-6 hour shifts and every single shift i’ve been put on dtw, dto, or solo drive thru. i haven’t touched the bar once. i stay on drive thru my entire shift without moving once. at my old store we were usually rotated multiple times a day. certain days i would be stuck on one position the majority of my shift or my entire shift, but we almost always moved around positions. my new store has lots of staffing &amp; my other was very understaffed and we still got rotated. i’ve asked once or twice subtly if i can maybe not be put on drive my entire shift and i still get put on drive. this new girl that transferred a week ago was put on cold bar immediately. i also worked as a borrowed partner at another store in my new state and i was also put on drive my entire shift. and it seems like my other coworkers get switched out for positions. like when someone goes on break. usually at my last store we’d swap to fill in for someone’s break, or if i’d come back from my break i’d fill in for someone else’s break in a new position. at my current store, when i come back for break i’m always put back onto drive. 
i asked my shift today if on tuesday i can possibly not be put on drive my entire shift and she said “we will see who’s here, maybe” and she’s the one that even mentioned how excessively i’m put on drive.
i may not have been working at starbucks for super long like others, but i’m very fast on bar &amp; other areas. it may not seem like a big deal but it is so repetitive, boring, and just genuinely exhausting doing the same thing everyday for my entire shift. greet customers, get payment, hand out drinks, take dt orders, hand out more drinks, repeat 10000 times. i’ve genuinely wanted to cry i get so frustrated. i hate it. i don’t know if it’s because they don’t think i’m capable of keeping up because we are a busy store, or because they don’t trust me in other areas, but i’m so tired and burnt out. if anyone could maybe tell me if this is normal or possibly explain why this is happening i’d be so so grateful.",always stuck on same position. please help
1327,starbucks,"recently i asked my reddit followers if they'd like to buy me a cup of coffee.  that's it, no promises in return, just if they'd like to buy me a coffee.  here's the link: [https://www.reddit.com/user/uberdrivingmom/comments/wgxsd7/would\_you\_buy\_me\_a\_cup\_of\_coffee\_the\_economy/](https://www.reddit.com/user/uberdrivingmom/comments/wgxsd7/would_you_buy_me_a_cup_of_coffee_the_economy/)

a few very good reddit friends and long time followers of my stories and content sent me starbucks cards to my email.  i in turn transferred the amount to my starbucks card.  

last night when i was done driving, i stopped by starbuck, of which i'm a very consistent customer, and lo and behold when i tried to buy my coffee, i was told i had a zero balance?  hmm, that's not right i thought.  sure enough when i checked the balance was zero point zero and the card was closed.

i checked my email to see if starbucks had notified me.  they had not.

i checked my phone to see if they'd called, since my number if on the account.  they had not.

perhaps an im, nope.

i then called starbucks and after being on hold while they investigated and sent me even to another tier 2 person, they gave me an answer.  starbucks security had flagged the card.  of the 12 donations, some number of them were flagged, disputed by the donator.  hmm a family member who didn't agree with the donation perhaps?  i don't know and starbucks wouldn't tell me.  they cancelled the whole card, took my balance to themselves and said i needed to wait 3-5 days while they looked into the issue further?

what really has be frustrated, besides starbucks not calling or notifying me (as all my personal info in in the app) is that two of the donations came through cards that were purchased through amazon.  a wonderful friend, who doesn't have a starbucks card bought the card through amazon and then forwarded it to me.  i added the code to my card to transfer it, and now that's gone too.  so in that case amazon got paid, starbucks got paid by amazon and then proceeded to take my card money for themselves.

i'll update this string as the case progresses but a warning to all those who get a bunch of cards for christmas or birthdays and such.  starbucks will, at their whim, close your account and keep the money that they've already been paid for.  nice scam starbucks!",starbucks cancelled my card and took the balance today.

however (im sure you can tell where this is going) my dm is a piece of work and is constantly on my sm about eeeeeverything. we are disgustingly understaffed because nobody wants to show up, and on top of that, we are supposed to be operating two stores at full capacity with mo&amp;p. we also, like every other store in the world, are out of product constantly.

all of this, plus the fact that he is constantly working overtime with no compensation bc he is salaried is very clearly driving him crazy. i feel so terrible for him. he works so hard for everybody who works here and it just sucks that this company makes everybody so fucking miserable :(

1. cleaned the ovens with bleach (the toilet cleaner) instead of oven cleaner because she refused to admit that she was wrong
2. had shifts write down the mood and behaviors of baristas and wrote one up for being in a bad mood
3. has blown up on baristas several times being blatantly rude because she’s stressed about something else
4. was adamant that teas are good for 72 hours (even though they’re not) and served expired tea because she didn’t want to admit that she was wrong again
5. has been snippy to partners instead of giving constructive criticism 
6. will be passive aggressive when her ego is hurt (many small instances that i won’t bore you guys with)
7. would constantly promise more hours to partners only to fall short and would get upset when more hours were asked for
8. has a tendency to dislike outspoken partners who are well liked amongst peers
9. watches the cameras at night from her house for hours when she isn’t in the store and will text the shift when she sees something she doesn’t like (this made a lot of people lose trust in her due to her literally watching us over our shoulders)
10. will refuse to let people stay late but will stay anywhere from 2-6 hours after her shift has ended, just sitting in the lobby on her laptop (aggravating a lot of partners)
11. got upset at a partner for offering to switch positions with another partner who had been on bar for 4 hours and was getting tired, making him stay on bar for no reason
12. talks badly about shifts to other baristas blatantly
13. told a barista on cafe/mobile that we were 20 mins behind just to stress her out and then walked away (didn’t get her help or offer to help herself)

to sum it up, my manager is someone who has a big and fragile ego not to mention the fact that she is a blatant hypocrite. she has made a lot of enemies and seems not to care of everyone’s low opinion of her. i have asked a lot of my coworkers about her and nobody has a high opinion of her. this is just what i’ve been told/observed, i’m sure there are more instances that i haven’t been around to see. her snarky and off-putting attitude not only rubs the baristas the wrong way, but even endangers the health of customers (1 &amp; 4). it has created almost a hostile work environment. is there anything that i can do that could be anonymous? i do not want her to hate me more than she does but her managerial style is making everyone absolutely miserable at my store.

later the shift pulls me aside saying i was questioning his authority and undermining him. i said there should be no situation where you yell at a customer and it was inappropriate. he responded with giving the rationale that she shouldn't have been there and how he was only ""a little yelling"". he then asked me to clock out three hours early and go home which i did. i'm frustrated with how he treated the customer and how he treated me. i've spoken to the manager through text and she seems to be taking my side, but i still am annoyed i woke up at 5 in the morning to only work 2.5 hours of my shift then be made to go home. i'm considering contacting ethics and compliance but i'm not sure.",shifts yelling at customer then sending me home early

at the investor day event later this month, starbucks will introduce its web3 effort, which incorporates nfts with a coffee theme. the business announced its plans to enter the web3 market earlier this year, claiming that its nfts would not only act as digital collectibles but would also grant their owners access to exclusive content and other benefits.

 at the time, starbucks provided few details regarding the appearance of its initial set of nfts, the exact functionality they would offer, or even the blockchain it was based on. it implied that there were still unfinished ideas by stating that the plan was probably multichain or chain agnostic. overall, the coffee retailer kept its web3 news fairly high level, explaining simply that it believed digital collectibles could create an accretive business adjust to its stores and that more would be revealed later in 2022.

starbucks appears to be taking a different strategy than some businesses, which hopped on the nft bandwagon without giving their investments much thought in terms of how they would fit with their overall corporate objectives. it sees the collections as a continuation of the devotion of its customers. adam brotman, the creator of the starbucks app and the company's mobile order &amp; pay system, was hired by the organization to assist as a special advisor on the project. in terms of technological advancements, starbucks' mobile order &amp; pay has been one of its greatest triumphs. 

even before apple pay became widely used, the corporation was one of the first to offer the idea of a digital wallet. starbucks mobile ordering has increased along with the growth of mobile payments more generally. mobile orders, delivery, and drive-through purchases made up 72 percent of starbucks' u.s. sales in the most recent quarter (their fiscal q3 period). additionally, as a result of changes in consumer behavior brought on by covid, the mobile ordering sales mix increased to a new high of 47 percent, up 13 percent year-over-year, the business stated.

starbucks posted strong earnings in the quarter, beating wall street’s expectations despite the economic challenges. the company reported revenue of $8.15 billion versus $8.11 expected, and earnings per share of 84 cents adjusted versus 75 cents expected. all in all the blockchain ecosystem has grown exponentially as more people and institutions adopt digital currencies as a means of exchange. the growth  blockchain innovations embodied by the expansion of the nft market as more establishments from various industries flock into the nft space to establish their presence, the success of blockchain games such as splinterlands and the growing popularity of blockchain-based social media platforms like tok lok app, peeteh, and minds.com, which offer users greater privacy and are less susceptible to censorship than web2 platforms like tik tok and facebook. these are all indicators of a growing acceptance of blockchain technology, digital currencies and other forms of digital assets.",starbucks is expanding it's reach into the metaverse. starbucks to unveil its web3-based rewards program next month.

1371,starbucks,"this happened about two weeks ago, caused me to call out the next day, and is partially responsible for someone quitting on their first day

so a woman a bit younger than me comes in while i'm on order support and she brings a been there mug to the counter, as i'm taking her order i'm making small talk and because she's buying the mug i ask where she's from, she's from the north east visiting my state for her birthday, asked her how she liked it and told her i hoped she had fun. as i tell her the total she pulls out her phone and is like let me scan my app, i'm a partner. i scan it and her partner discount applies to all her items, i tell her the new total, she pays and goes to wait at the end of the bar.

i turned back to work on backups again, but i guess as she was waiting she looked at her receipt on her phone and came back up and was like ""did the sale apply to the mug?"" she said sale so i'm like i'm not sure i didn't know there was a sale on the mugs. she asks me to ask my manager, manager isn't in so i ask my shift supervisor, who's doing the pull in the back, if she knew about any sale on the mugs. she says no. i go back up and tell her we're not aware of any sales. she switches up and says ""partner discount"" this time so i'm like oh yeah your discount did apply for $3.89.

she then asks me to go get my manager, so i go get my shift supervisor. who when caught up on the situation, prints out her receipt and shows her that her discount did apply. the woman then flips her lid and raises her voice saying that the discount didn't apply. my shift shows her again on the physical receipt that it did and tells her this was a misunderstanding. so she raises her voice even more to the point my shift even asked her to maybe quiet down, i've been standing next to my shift at the register silent except for when i needed to tell details, but she jabs a finger at me and says ""i want her name (my name tag has my name in old english font) and i want corporates number."" without stuttering my shift goes ""*their* name."" she gets belligerent at this point, telling us we're being rude and this isn't standard and how can we call ourselves a corporate store. all over a misunderstanding that she took part in.

so she tells my shift she wants corporates number, she wants my manager's number, and she wants the dm's number and my shift just gives her the store card because she keeps repeatedly demanding the numbers in a different order. at this point, my shift is just matching her energy and she asks for corporates number again and my shift finally tells her to google it. she can't get any upsetter than she already is but goes ""why don't you know that information"", as a partner that's a ridiculous double standard. my shift finally just voids her entire order and tells her to leave and i go to the back to have water because her reaction to 'a small misunderstanding that wasn't even a real problem' had shaken me as had her yelling. my shift finally passes me in the back as i'm getting ready to go back up and i ask her what's going on and she just tells me we're done dealing with her.

i go back up front, assuming she had done as she was told and left, but she's still in the lobby and as soon as she sees me come out of the back goes ""why didn't you tell me your district manager was out of office till august?"" i didn't know. ""you don't have a note in the back?"" no. she then demands my manager's personal number and says corporate says we're allowed to give that out. (which is a huge no.) i'm like so out of energy at this point from her yelling i just apologize to her. and she goes ""i don't think you are sorry."" for once in my life, i actually was sorry. i don't know what she wanted to hear and i didn't ask. she then goes ""this is exactly how i wanted to spend my birthday"" yeah and this is exactly how i wanted to spend my shift.

she then goes outside and paces in front of the store while on the phone with corporate i guess? and i go to the back again to try and get back on track with what i was doing. apparently, in that time her mom came in and asked us our side of the story. my shift calls our manager to clue her in on what's going on while the woman is still pacing in front of the store and around her car. i was supposed to get off a good ten minutes ago by now so my shift while still on the phone with our manager tells someone who is training (both the partner and bean watched the whole thing go down) to take over order support from me so i can clock out. i then just hid in the back for ten minutes or so before going home.

i called out the next day because it had stressed me out to the point of causing me physical pain but when i came in the day after i was told the bean had quit and that my manager was going to call her manager. i haven't had an update and suspect i might not get one. but since then i've had stress headaches every day and my anxiety has caused me some pretty nasty acid reflux, as well as crying spells here and there but i'm transferring this weekend and am hoping a different environment will help me.",out of state partner lost it on me

well… it’s because about half of the time, my drink doesnt come with the sweetener.
some experienced baristas would take my order but a newbie would make my drink and forgets to put the sweetener in. 
i would walk back into the store and ask for the syrup again. 

funny thing is, even when i order it via mobile to skip the hassle, the sweetener option says its default 6 pumps of classic sweetener and grayed out. 
if real i’m lucky, i would get my drink sweetened but most of the time without. the order on the sticker wouldnt even indicate to put sweetener in. 

so, when i try to save time by ordering ahead with mobile, i would customize and ask for 5 pumps of syrup instead so that my drink needs “special care” lol 

it happens quite often believe it or not. even last night, i walked in, ordered venti iced coffee with soy with classic sweetener.
when i drank the coffee, it wasn’t sweetened at all. 

i went back and told the barista *politely* that my drink was not sweetened (its routine for me) and she looked frustrated and said “well, how much sweetener do you want?”… well it wasn’t sweetened at all. i told her to give it 5 more pumps of syrup. 

later i found out she was new and she thought one pump of sweetener was enough (for venti?) 

can you guys do something about it on your system? this happens to me most of the time.

1441,starbucks,"hello all, i have a question regarding the change in oat milk. to note, i'm canadian so i am not sure if its different here than from the states/worldwide. 

i'm aware that starbucks has changed their oat milk, iirc it was oatly before? honestly not a fan of the new oat milk, i've now switched to almond but that's beside my point. 

i'm extremely gluten intolerant (in the process of figuring out if celiac) and upon the last time i had gotten my usual  iced coffee with oat milk--which was the point in time where i realized it's different from the previous oat milk--i had a reaction maybe 10 minutes after consuming the drink, and i had chugged almost half of it lol. i broke out into itchy rashes all over my hands and arms. 

now, i eat a vegan and gluten free diet, and have been doing so for over 6 years now. i know i had not consumed any gluten or dairy (very intolerant to both), so my only attribution to those rashes would be the new oat milk.

on the next visit to starbucks i had asked the barista if she could please check the oat milk label for me to see if it said gluten free, and she said she didn't see anything on the box. i would just like to confirm, if anybody knows, if the current new oat milk is for sure not gluten free (and which brand if possible too). thank you in advance :)

sidenote: i think it's very important to notify customers on changes like these. people have allergies and intolerances, so this information should be made known--perhaps maybe it was in other places, but in my store that i've frequented since it was built like 10 years ago, i saw no signs or anything. for example, my mother who *is* celiac had a small sip of said coffee that gave me rashes. thankfully she was fine, but i couldn't imagine if she had gone for her usual matcha latte and ended up very sick for consuming gluten without knowing. 

thanks again, have an awesome day everybody :)",oat milk switch up

1455,starbucks,"i was hired on as an ssv a few months ago.

my managers gave me a few months to learn the floor before transitioning, and i just started running shifts on my own the other day. 
i have such mixed feelings on it. i like sending partners on breaks, doing the extra tasks that come with it so i’m always busy, and overall just trying to ensure nobody leaves having a bad day because of the way i ran a shift. i’m still learning, but i know that i’ll excel in shift tasks. 

however, i have social anxiety and i’m very introverted. none of the other shifts or managers are like this and it’s making me insecure. they all have this uplifting energy, communicate with each other, have fun with their partners. there are some days i don’t really talk at all, such as yesterday. i only worked 3 hours but i didn’t say a word to anybody. i was working my 7th day in a row and my social battery was just done. 

i feel like i don’t fit in. the partners are all friends with each other and other shifts, excited about working with each other, have little groups, and i just don’t feel involved even after being there for 5 months. i get along with everybody, but i know and feel that my lack of communication and introverted personality is off-putting to some. i’ve been leaving shifts feeling mentally exhausted and defeated, not because of the work, but socially.

they ordered a triple with a splash of heavy cream. i queued the shots, got two bad pulls, and brewed a third because i figured if you’re going to drink straight espresso, it shouldn’t be shitty. his drink was out in maybe a minute after ordering it.

gave it a one second splash of heavy cream, lidded it and handed to them &amp; then he called me back, started shouting, &amp; threw hot espresso at me.

1504,starbucks,"my tale of woe:
i’ve been working at starbucks since ‘07. 
i moved up and became a store manager and have been for five years now. 
last year i had to transfer districts after my cafe store was closed (covid decimated sales). i was placed in a busier cafe but it was manageable. my new dm was an absolute monster. (he is not longer with the company, as is my rm). he closed my new store down “temporarily” which turned into a year. i got flung from store to store. managers quitting left and right. had a hundred partners texting me constantly. finally ended up in the most nightmare scenario cafe store that had not had a leader in the store for a year plus. cherry on top was being shorted on my annual raise (which, still never was put thru payroll before my dm quit)
i had my breaking point after three months. 
this january i took an loa; approved for std. 
i took my entire 26 weeks and had to deal with both unum (which i thought was a ny based ltd company?) and sedgwick. 
i recently just got approval for an accommodation leave (under sedgwick’s std) from 7/7-9/25/22. the paperwork they sent me seems confusing and i’ve logged into the benefits and read through everything i could find; which is a lot of convoluted corporate jargon nonsense. 
to simplify my help need, i’ll just write out a portion of what they sent me:

“starbucks accommodation leave from july 7, 2022 through september 25, 2022. your absences under this leave will be counted against your starbucks accommodation leave entitlement.”

and i have no idea what the hell that even means. i logged into mypartnerinfo to see my ben and loa hours but bc i wasn’t on my store laptop a lot was hidden and i was unable to click on any checks to view. 

i’m hopeful that someone here has had a similar situation and could explain to me what this means. my last mailed check says my ben hours as 20. is that what they paid me or how much i have left. 

maybe these are stupid questions but any advice, help, or info would be greatly appreciated!",help&amp;q’s with loa

1510,starbucks,"mini rant: i work at an extremely busy location one of the reserve locations in fact, (i won’t say which one) but i worked core for two years prior to that as a ssv. i’ve always had a particular distaste for people who lie about their pets so they can bring into starbucks for a cute photo op, simply because the principle is wrong and we can get in trouble for it if something happens.

it’s been sooo much worse where i work now since everyone and their mother wants a picture of their pup in the ✨roastery✨. don’t get me wrong, i grew up with dogs and loooove them, but i feel it’s completely inappropriate to lie about your pet or esa being a service animal simply because you think you’re entitled to bring them wherever you go. (note: in my state, service animals and esas are not considered the same thing when it comes to bringing them into food service establishments). i’ve done a lot of research about the topic and have even considered looking into a service animal to help with my disability. hence why it’s so heartbreaking to see this level of entitlement everywhere. 

most of all, being in a space crowded with a couple hundred (or more) people on a busy day and then having dogs wandering around and even barking and doing all kinds of clearly non-service-animal behaviour is extremely overwhelming to my neurodivergent brain and for a lot of my coworkers. doesn’t help that of course management only cares about preserving the customer experience and encourages us to not even ask if an animal is a proper service animal...do people not realize they can have their animals seized by the state as a result of their thinking they’re more important than everywhere else? 

note: i understand when it’s hot outside and you don’t want your dog tied up in the heat. where i live is not that hot of a climate, and as a pet owner myself i understand the importance of thinking ahead when you have your pet with you.",i can’t stand entitled people who lie so they can bring their pets into food service places and pretending they’re “service animals”.

1513,starbucks,"at my store, we have a regular who comes in almost every day named michelle (if you are reading this, fuck you, you miserable no life stupid old bitch) who comes in and order a grande or venti mocha frappuccino with soy, no whip, and two shots in a trenta cup. 

if anyone at the register tells her the obvious, that we can't do it in a trenta cup, she ""informs us"" that our sm has given her specific permission and that we need to just right it in as an ask me. this most recent shift that i was stuck on cold bar, i begged/semi-forced my ssv to call the sm to make sure and to ask if we can stop allowing it. she said no and that she did give her specific permission to get her fraps in a trenta and that we just have to do it. history: this store manager is relatively new and our store itself has a history with her and she was banned by our previous manager for harassment. 

after pos, she walks down to the handoff lane at our store and stands directly in front of it with a straw waiting, even if there are people up before her. she will watch the entire time you make her frappuccino. if the shots sit for longer than 30 seconds, she will stop you and make you restart. she counts the number of pumps as you do it. after it's done, she will almost always question the barista. if she suspects you put less pumps of anything required, she will make you remake it. she had one of our newer baristas pull out the coffee base syrup and show it to her and then proceeded to tell her she forgot it. i trained her. she didn't forget it, and she told her kindly it wouldn't have blended to that consistency if she had forgotten the base but she would be happy to remake it if it tasted unusual. she walked out upset after, must've tasted the same so she ate her words.

that brings me to the point of my question. she is harrassing quite a few of our employees, especially newer ones who may be a little slower on the frap routine and when they were just taught not to do trenta fraps. our sm doesn't seem to care and just wants us to bend over and take it. even worse, she frequently misgenders one of our employees and our sm was informed. no action taken. not the first time this employee has been misgendered under this sm and no action was taken even though it was brought up. both customers continue to misgender him whenever they come in while he is working. 

is it worth my time to bring this inaction to the attention of my district managers? should i focus on the selling of fraps in a trenta cup at our store and email corporate? what should i start with to either get her banned again for harassment or to stop getting her way with the frappuccinos...she makes everyone shrink or shake whenever she walks in the door.",recommendation on course of action with problematic customer.

1540,starbucks,"starbucks is my safe haven from home, i recently graduated and go and job search there every day, usually for 6-8 hours at a time. i used to be able to buy drinks, but my financial situation changed and until ""i'm over this gay thing"" certain folks have pulled all financial support so i'm hustling to find my first post-grad job asap. 

anyways today, i asked to have one of the drinks that had been sitting there for hours (i was hungry, and my sugar was low) this barista was so kind and offered to remake the drink for me and asked what i liked, they ended up making something i had never tried before (it was delicious and extra sugary), and it helped immensely with my sugar issue. i felt so embarrassed to even ask because i'm basically begging for a freebie, but she treated me so kindly, today has been extra rough and i really needed that today. thank you.

1555,starbucks,"hi, i'm new at sb, joined for the coverage for trans surgeries. i was aware of the potential changes about to hit but have some questions.

1- where can i find the # for my trans advocate?
2- my understanding is that the changes are: we now need to pay co-payments until our out of pocket maximum is met, correct?
3- regardless of (2), starbucks will/was paying for procedures not covered by insurance. still correct? for example i can get kaiser via sb but a body contouring/bbl isn't typically covered. does this mean that sb would pay for it?
4- considering all of this, i'm assuming if i wanted something done not covered by insurance, i'd have to pay the full amount, and get it reimbursed. yes?

i'll ask the advocate but hoping to get a general sense of what to expect.

i'm already on kaiser, paid for by myself, and met $7.5k / 12k max out of pocket costs already. so the ffs surgeries i have planned are probably better off with my current coverage, along with anything else kaiser covers, until i reach things that they don't, like the bbl/contouring.

anyway, im explaining to customers how i can do frappucinos (with the exception of the espresso frappuccino), iced teas, iced coffee, refreshers, iced chais and cold brew - that my espresso machine is completely down and i can't even steam any milk for hot drinks either but i always assured them that it should be back up and running soon as we're waiting for someone to fix it. we also wrote down the situation on paper and are using those as makeshift signs which 90% of the time aren't even read by customers (not that i can blame them)

here comes this gentleman. i explain the situation after he requests a triple grande iced mocha (i guess i assumed he read the sign and assumed he would order something that i could do?), and he death stares me and says, ""so no espresso?"" before i could assure him that someone was coming to fix it and it'll be back up and running soon. he then accuses me of breaking it myself(?) so i just wouldn't have to sell espresso. i let him know the machine is just old and that it was overworked the past few days to keep up with demands, but it'll be fixed soon. he goes on this rant about how only baristas spew bullshit out of their ass, that im refusing him service, etc.

1568,starbucks,"my car is in the shop so i have had to take a kick scooter (like those folding, push powered razor scooters many had as kids) to and from work every shift. it takes me about 20 minutes to to get there (longer to get back) and wears me the heck out. i have to get to work in time to take a change out of sweaty clothes, drink some water, and sit for a breath for a minute. then on to my shift.  thats been not the most enjoyable but manageable.  well its been raining heavily here, and i need to fix a wheel on my scooter, so i got ready for my morning shift this morning and ordered a lyft. well i had insufficient funds (odd because i recently got payed). i checl my bank account and i had 250+ dollars stolen from it. so i called my store and explained i had 250+ dollars stolen from my account and didnt have a way to get in. shift said it was ok. i waited til my bank opened and called them and i'm still dealing with that chaos. but my manager called and asked when i was coming in. i told him the situation in detail and he said that it wasnt an emergency because the banks are open until 5 and that it could wait. i said i didnt have a way in and he said ""you live close by right?"" i said kinda, its about a 20+ minute walk in good conditions and he said i should have just walked. now hes saying i need to come in later today and pick up a shift tomorrow.

earlier this month my dog was sick. not in the usual dogs get upset stomachs sick, but not eating, no energy, so much diarrhea and vomiting. when i called in then he said that wasnt an emergency either and i could take my dogs to the vet after work and then pressured me to come in so bad, i caved and and went to mys bift keaving my sick dog at home (which i still hate myself for doing). my dog was sick for a few more days after but my manager still was like ""thats not a real emergency"" and told me i cant call out for things like that. he also ahd a very disapprovinf tone in his voice whenever we talked about it.

well today when he called me to say having nearly all my money stolen and no way to get to work was ""not an emergency"" and that i need to come in later today and pick up a shift tomorrow, he brought up the incident with my dog saying i have to stop calling out for things thay arent emergencies. despite me actually showing up anyway when my dog was at home sick.

on top of all that he said i have to work more than 12 hours or else i am letting everyone else down and it will negatively impact my employment. he kept bringing up how serious thay was and how much he wanted to emphasize it. which i fully agree. except he keeps only scheduling me for 10 hours a week. meaning even if i didnt call out ever i still wouldnt be merting that expectation. 

i am so incredibly upset by that complete and utter lack of empathy, especially in moments where i am already incredibly stressed. i am also incredibly upset thay he is basically putting pressure on me and implying i could lose my job for a matter he is completely in control of...but he acts like thats on me.

i am so incredibly not confrontational and get horrible anxiety so i just dont know what to do here. my heart is telling me to quit but my brain is shouting ""don't"" because i have no backup. i'd tough it out, look elsewhere, and give a 2 weeks notice when i find something, but without a car thats gonna make finding something incredibly difficult if not impossible. and i dont know how to contact hr. the partner contact center really confuses me. plus i do actually like starbucks and most of my fellow partners.

1579,starbucks,"in my time as a barista, (i am approaching a year in a few months) i don’t recall having someone ask for orange juice. however, today apparently it was desperately needed by one of our customers.

i have never seen this customer before, but apparently she had come in two days prior and asked about our orange juice and the people working that day told her it’d be there today. 

she came to order at drive through and asked if we had orange juice. i asked if she meant the evolution drink (we only had the fresh organic defense up one and i don’t remember the last time we had regular orange) and she started raising her voice and told me that she was told it would be in that day. i told her that we do have warehouse shortages and a lot of times we order things but they are not guaranteed to come in because of these shortages. she didn’t take that as an answer and insisted it was supposed to be in today and i kept looking but didn’t find it. i proceeded to have everyone check and look around for it but we still couldn’t find it. she asked for a manager and i told her our general manager wasn’t in at the moment but she could talk to a shift manager.

at this point i realized that she was recording me. she had her phone out the window pointed towards the order screen and was making faces. i was really uncomfortable by this (being a minor) and i told my coworkers that she was recording me and i was getting really upset and flustered. i tend to overthink a lot so i was scared if i was doing something wrong and i could get people in trouble, even though it was just orange juice.

she asked for my general manager’s name and i gave her the first name but i have really bad memory so i didn’t know his last name. she also asked for his phone number so i said i don’t know it but i can look for a business card for her. she proceeded to be silent and continue recording and then pulled out of the line and left.

i’m not sure if she came back, as i said before i have bad memory so i don’t recall faces or last names very well. there were two different people i thought was her and i think she could’ve come back to order something but if she did, she didn’t say anything. for the rest of the day, however, i was really upset about the interaction. i get flustered very easily and stutter and confuse my words, so i was worried if i said something wrong. 

at the end of the day, what this was about was orange juice. we have a gas station right next door that you can get orange juice from, why go to a starbucks for it? why are you trying to have a gotcha moment over it? if it was one of the more popular items i would understand (not really, but it would make more sense) but it’s something you could literally get anywhere, and i’ve tried it once before and it tastes like any other orange juice. 

my message to all customers:
whether it be a starbucks or any other place, please please please show the workers some respect. i have countless stories of customers that have made me uncomfortable, yelled at me, and degraded me. 

i work at starbucks because i love what i do. i’ve met the best people working there and have made so many friends. i should not be dreading my interactions with the customers. there are so many customers that are so sweet, but as always, the bad apples ruin it for me. my store is honestly such a welcoming environment, it feels like a second home to me and it’s basically my safe space, (i don’t have the best home life and i look to my coworkers as family) so to feel so much negativity of the customers taking their anger out on us just kinda sucks. 

idk maybe i’m just overreacting, my job is to make drinks and interact with customers, good and bad. i just think that maybe there could be some room for respect and to not abuse the “customer is always right” phrase. (i am not saying a customer can’t be right of course, but fighting to get your way when it’s literally just an overpriced drink that is out of stock and that you could get a gallon of next door for way cheaper is a little much) i’d understand if people were nice about it, but to treat me like i was scamming you out of your precious orange juice is just a little out of line. 

like no i specifically made sure there weren’t any orange juices because i knew you were coming in. bro i don’t know who you are, please stop treating me like a robot. are you trying to take legal action because we’re out of stock? i don’t know what the goal was and you guys can see i’m getting unnecessarily mad about this, sorry. it just really rubbed me the wrong way.",orange juice?

1589,starbucks,"4 years as a barista trainer, *and* prior barista experience. my last loa meeting survey had “advising” for *all but one* area. and my new sm put me in pod training as a trainee.

i’m really upset and angry, truthfully. i’m skilled at my job. i would be a huge asset to train people on bar, which i think is pretty needed with sbux’s shitty training.

i’m going to be “trained” by someone who has less than half my tenure. 

i’m tired of being treated this way. i feel i’m always given the short end of the stick, in terms of recognition. my first sm, trainer and some shifts have vouched for me many times. even my super bitchy ex-sm recognized my tenure and title.

basically i feel like i’m treated like i’m a fool, incompetent. there are other reasons but this is icing on the cake. (especially since my first sm had me leading training sessions anyways.)

i don’t know how to express this without sounding like a bitch. but it feels insulting. makes me want to quit, like these 4 years are just worthless apparently.","4 years as barista trainer, yet i’m not leading pod training."

at target, i'm currently making 16.58 an hour. but starbucks starting wage is 15.50, and i'm starting to maybe regret my decision on getting a job at starbucks. would it be weird to ask for a raise already when i've not even started? i just feel like i deserve more than starting wage since i have 2 years of barista experience under my belt, whereas the average new hire has none. it also sucks to go to a new job making less than before, too.  my friend works at the starbucks i interviewed at and said i should wait at least 3 months but...i don't really want to wait that long. she was also doubtful that even i did ask about it during my interview, that the manager would have agreed. i just have car payments and am trying to save for college and literally every dollar counts.

1610,starbucks,"hello! i just had a simple question about corrective actions. 

i am aware that they prevent you from promoting or transferring for six months after the corrective action, but i had two questions:

a) do they stack if you get more than one? (i.e if you get two on, let’s say the same day, you would have to wait 12 months) or do they simply refresh the six month duration starting from the most recent corrective action?


b) since i can’t transfer or promote for six months, i feel as if it is worth it to work at my local corner store for basically the same pay but 100000x less stressful in the meantime. if i left and did this, would my six month period be up after six months pass, or do i have to continuously work at starbucks for six months or else the “timer” for it will pause until i come back? (ex: say i left in january and my six month period ended in july. say i work somewhere else until july and then come back; would the corrective action still be there, or would i have to wait until november (aka six months from july)?

1614,starbucks,"so, picture this. it’s near close (maybe 45 minutes before closing) in a drive thru store. you’re the ssv with only two other partners for at least the last 2 hours.

in walks this man, with his own cup. he buys a hot tea- jade citrus mint and a mint majesty tea bag with some soy milk. within 10 minutes, he’s ordering a refill. changing the tea up- this time it’s emperor’s cloud and a jade citrus mint with soy. then he needs to go to the bathroom. spends maybe two minutes in the bathroom and orders another refill, changing the tea bags again. you’re finally on your last ten minutes before close, you have one partner running drive and making their own drinks, the other is taking care of the floors and bathrooms and you need to get the patio furniture put away. the man comes up and asks for a blonde pour over as his refill. 

now just imagine, you think he’s a nightmare you won’t have to see again because he hadn’t been around for weeks. he shows up at noon and spends his entire afternoon at your starbucks, finally asking for a pour over. the best part? the day was completely dead until 3 pm, and then stayed busy for the rest of the night. at 3 pm (the beginning of your shift) all the trashes are overflowing, the team is out of whip cream and hot coffee, and an oven is off while waiting to get cleaned. he’s visiting for refills often. it hits 6:30 pm. you have 3 newer partners who are all still learning different things and need a little extra support. you have a frozen order to put away, the pull hasn’t been started, you have 2 lunches to run, no closing tasks have been done, and the opener didn’t do the frozen part of the inventory count all while you lose a partner at 8:30. and you close at 9.

the mocha was a half pump size and no one know. they had the condiment sugar holder on top on the cold bar riser where you would see the iced teas and refreshers. they also has the hot teas on the other riser. so right away i tried to follow the siren eye with store layout. my store is very very small and i’m have some problems but think i’ve figured out the best way to work it. i have this new barista that started training around the same time i took over the store. it’s her first job and she is doing amazing. she offers to come in when people call out. she’s there when people need her. and she was proposed to being certified in daily ops. but she keeps changing things around. idk if i should just let it happen or if i should keep moving it back. 

if your reading this far and are lost let me give more detail. 

so the cold bar to the siren eye is to be next to each other. but i don’t have enough space to have it next to each other no matter what i do. i did think of something this morning but idk if it would work. i would have to move the brewer and put it next to the pos and move the tea cold bar where the brewer is. but there would be a lot of extra space with the refresher making it longer to reach and dead space. there is a 5 layer syrup stand by the frap station and she keeps wanted to get rid of it saying we don’t need all that syrup. and she wanted to put the refresher fruit pieces by the frappe station. i’m not saying i’m not open to new ideas but i don’t see how that would seem like the correct way to set it up. what should i do?",store level help please

that store was much better, but the issues in the company were obviously there too. the labor cuts, call outs, and unrealistic expectations were exhausting. i was so burned out from being the reliable tenured partner. the few times i wasn’t on bar, i’d end up either getting switched with someone or getting stuck catching someone up because i was the one that could do it. i was the one who always came in early or stayed late, and after years of going above and beyond for no recognition, i just stopped caring. i have carpal tunnel in my hand from barring, i’m sleep deprived, and getting yelled at by customers every day was emotionally exhausting.

thank god it was an iced drink - i didn't know what else to do but plead for her forgiveness. she was obviously probably upset but not too mad- that was before she asked for the bathroom and i mentioned that they were closed. she starts arguing with me ... i told her i'm not the one making the rules so she asks for my ssv. 

he ends up letting her use the bathroom anyways which makes sense in hindsight and i ended up feeling bad for telling her no in the beginning... we're very strict with the washroom policy so i didn't think we would allow her i should've asked if we could make an exception.

1643,starbucks,"this is uncommon compared to the vast amount of customers that will try to ""hack"" their way into getting extras but i've had multiple experiences where people have some personal issue with accepting a free drink or remake and i genuinely don't understand

i tried to offer a venti frappuccino i made in error to someone about to order (he was the only guy in the café), explained that it would be unsellable within 5 minutes and would be thrown away. he insisted i charge him for a tall latte if he took it and i was like sir that will literally make my life more difficult than if you take this drink for zero money and he said ""i don't take things for free""

same with this lady that refused to let me remake her drink iced, she insisted on just taking a cup of ice and pouring the hot latte over it. we weren't even busy! or customers that try to pay the difference if you make their drink a larger size by mistake.

like! guys!! we made $20 billion last year! you're not shorting us in literally any way! this isn't a judgment call about whether i think you need charity or can afford starbucks! we throw away hundreds of dollars of product every week! no this isnt a gotcha moment! just take the free drink‼️",why do some customers refuse to take things for free
1644,starbucks,"hi everyone, just had a quick question about starbucks policies and if this specific situation could get me in trouble and if so what the punishment/repercussions could be. (i’m sorry i’m on mobile)

so a while ago a manager was watching my store, and she wasn’t being a very good manager. she wasn’t listening to our baristas or working with us. she would deny vacations and availability changes without reason, and a lot of her actions were stressing out my coworkers.

i heard from another person that she had been acting like this at other stores too, so i decided to be proactive and try to get stories from other partners to bring to ethics and compliance. no one ever responded so i left it at that, never made a complaint, and just waited out the rest of the time i worked with the manager. 

well apparently, one of the partners i reached out to has shown the manager what i had been doing, and i was curious if i did, unknowingly, break a rule and if so what might happen",what could i get in trouble for?
1645,starbucks,words of my coworker who just witnessed a “i don’t know what i am ordering so what you made me was wrong” moment. we all fucking know that a cappuccino is supposed to have foam; majority foam even. so this lady orders one with almondmilk so i steamed it literally perfect and gave it to her. like 5 minutes later she comes back up to the register and says “this cappuccino has too many bubbles” in a slight attitude and proceeded to demand a vanilla latte with almondmilk be made bc she definitely didn’t ask. one of my coworkers made it (thanks!!!) and gave it to her and that was the end of that. anywho moral of the story please know what you are ordering. especially when the drink you ordered was made the correct way.,“my cappuccino is too cappuccino-y”

1649,starbucks,"hi all! 👋 i've recently been offered an sm position with starbucks. i've been lurking on the subreddit because it helped me so much with my old company- walmart. i learned so much there from the associates. 

i was a salaried manager for walmart the past 3 years after working my way through the ranks from temporary cashier and was honestly just tired of the way my bosses were treating myself and my team, so i started looking for something else. i found starbucks!

i'm hoping i can get some tips from you all here. i've read that many people have strong dislike for externally hired asms and sms. i'm a firm believer of making sure my employees want to work with me, and are comfortable working with me. i was always on the floor with my associates at walmart, working beside them. obviously, i have next to no knowledge on how to be a batista, but i'd love some tips. tips on how to keep my baristas happy as well as tips on barring and everything. any help is appreciated. 😊",external sm hire- words of wisdom?

i get that being a barista doesn’t really come with any cool or exciting skills that other places will look at and find interesting. but for whatever reason being able to put coffee master on a resume or in idle conversation really honestly makes me feel like i’m significant? i want to be able to say i accomplished something. but the more i think about it, will it help me get a decent job at another coffee shop? it is it just meaningless outside of starbucks itself ? i’m really torn.",is the black apron worth it?

1663,starbucks,"when i was first interviewed w starbucks, i made sure to ask the questions about things i would like to know such as will i have enough hours to be eligible for benefits? because i have multiple ongoing health issues i’d like to address. was told yes, asked if i would get at least ~23 hrs. was told yes. hours from the beginning were under 16. talked to multiple sm’s(we had 2) about it. got nothing when they said they could fix it. 
i explicitly told them i would have to find another job if they couldn’t fix it. constant attitude from an ssv and the sm. got asked if i found coverage when i called and told them i couldn’t make it because i woke up ill.

1664,starbucks,"today, i went to starbucks to study and ordered a vanilla latte as my original drink. during that same visit, i finished that latte and went to request a refill with a cold brew. however, i was informed by one of the baristas that only “approved drinks” are allowed for refills and lattes are not one of those. 

i let the barista know that i have had done this same transaction of ordering an iced latte as an original drink and getting a refill with a cold brew in the past before at the same starbucks.

perplexed, i showed him the faq below : https://customerservice.starbucks.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/6778/~/how-do-refills-work%3f

however, he was insistent that my request is not allowed per the rules. he did end up saying he would give me a one-time exception. i thanked him for the exception and ended up tipping $5 in the tip jar, as i took about 4 minutes of his time and didn’t want to seem like a karen lol as i frequent this starbucks. overall, the conversation was polite with a serious tone. both of us felt certain we were correct with the interpretation of the refill policy haha

i was generously curious about the interpretation of the refill policy, so i re-read it again and i feel like my situation was within this faq policy. the only “loophole” i could see is if they are not a “participating store” or this store has a new store-specific refill policy. maybe refill policies vary by store or the refill policy changed due to “inflation times”?

anyways, thanks for reading this block of text. if anyone could post the current “refill policy” that would be great!",did starbucks refill policy change?

1667,starbucks,"i dont feel like typing a book about it rn. but pretty much when i came to work, the lobby was closed and a table was placed right in front of the door for picking up mobile orders. plus, cars were wrapped around the entire building. i heard many people called out, so there were 4 of us there for all that chaos. 

i was put on warming, having to do food and take it to drive thru and to the front of the store for mobile pick up. there were also people at the door confused and had questions, and i tried answering them as much as possible because… i can’t turn my backs to them.. it’s not good customer service. i’d be slightly behind on food after trying to take care of them, so i was a little stressed. 

then my sv tells me to do mobile bar while i don’t have food, which was extremely overwhelming because i have to listen for dt orders, check for mobile stickers in two places, and one other thing: i’ve been working at sbux two months today. i’m still not used to all the drinks, only mostly refreshers, frappuccino’s, and shaken espressos. it was sort of hard to ask for help when we were short staffed and everyone had to take care of their own things… 

the last straw for me was when i was back at the door answering people’s questions, and then my sv yelled across the whole store to me to just ask their names for orders and keep it moving. how am i supposed to just ignore the customers? it’s not good for business and i thought it was a thing to listen to the customer. so i turned my backs to them and walked back and i was ready to have a breakdown. she asked if i needed a break and i went to the bathroom and cried, trying to suck it all up and get back out there. then when i came out she told me to clock it early and i felt weird about that since they’d have one less person and idk how that would look with my sm. i asked if she was sure and i’d feel bad leaving them. she said i was in no condition to work and she’d rather me go home… 

it’s currently weighing on me. i texted my sm to let her know and so i can discuss it with her since she’s going to have to be informed.

a shift didn’t show up at their scheduled time. the current shift *has* to be somewhere and can’t stay late (in fact already stayed an hour past in case the incoming shift forgot the schedule changed). manager says she can’t be there for almost two hours, and the shift is not allowed to leave the store, either running without a key holder present, nor can they lock up the store until the next available person arrives to either open back up or properly close and clean.

is there a codified rule? are they allowed to lock up and leave? obviously i think the manager should have told people in advance what to do in this situation, but right now no one is available, and because this shift happens to be at the store they are therefore the one being forced to stay.

1684,starbucks,"tldr: i cannot stand working with this one specific ssv. she is absolutely awful at her job.

i have been working at starbucks for 8 months and was promoted to ssv about a month ago, which was the second time i had interviewed. a couple of my shifts encouraged me to interview, but i wasn’t expecting to get it because at the time i had only been working there for 6 months. i thought it wouldn’t hurt to try though, so i gave it a shot. the first time i interviewed, i was not offered the promotion, but it was offered to this other girl, and let’s call her anna. i held no resentment towards anna when she was promoted because she had been working there longer than me (2+ years) and i thought she deserved it. 

i held no resentment until my shifts started telling me how they wish i had gotten it because she sucks at the job and when another shift told me my sm said the only reason i had not gotten it was because anna had more examples of coaching than me, and if i had had more, i would’ve gotten it over her. i still didn’t quite understand why they thought anna was a bad shift.

a month later i was promoted to ssv. all the ssvs that had worked with me during my practice shifts had told me that i was already better at the job than anna. i still didn’t understand why. i did thought get a little annoyed with her because she would just stand around doing nothing when there were clearly things to do and i had to instruct her on what to do when she should’ve been able to take initiative by herself. she’s not a green bean.

i finally understand why now that i’m working as an ssv alone. anna is not good at her job and is a pain to work with. she spends a lot of her time on the shift on her phone. when she is supposed to be doing the 3 hour pull, she is on her phone. she takes 20 minute breaks. she gives incredibly wrong information to the baristas. there was this one time she told all the baristas their 10 starts at the time it says on the ticket on their partner beverage they get on break.  so even if you’re waiting in line for 5 minutes to get a drink, your break doesn’t start until the time it says on the ticket. that is so incredibly not true (at least at my store). your break starts the time you step off the floor and now i have to correct every single barista she told this made up rule about.

her sense of urgency is so frustrating. she has none. we will be super behind on a crazy busy day and she will spend 10 minutes gossiping with the baristas instead of doing her job, which causes me to have to pick up her slack. it is so incredibly hard for me to get used to this position when i am doing two people’s jobs at once. she cannot read the room at all. i will be literally scrambling around trying to get tasks done or the pull done or do a restock and she will just follow me around telling me about her weekend plans or how she’s so excited for this one event coming up. it is so hard to not tell her to shut up, but i have resorted to just ignoring what she’s saying, looking at her, and saying to her “anna, do your job.” 

every shift she hands off to me is incredibly behind, even when there was no reason for it to be behind at all. 

there was one day they were super behind because it had been busy all day (it was double star day, i believe) and i came in at 4:30 . she lets me know all the barista tasks that were done (just foh floors and bathrooms) and rushes out of there. it was super behind and we were down a person as well. we didn’t get to starting syrups until about 6, when we usually start those around 4. the baristas and i somehow manage to get syrups, hot bars, cold bar, sinks, the pull, and milk count done by like 7:15. at 7:15, i decided i was going to count the drawers real quick because we need to get back floors done before we lose a barista at 8. i go to open the safe and the change order is sitting there in door 1 (it’s not even supposed to be in door 1). i was stressed out of my mind at this point because i couldn’t figure out how we were going to get a restock, back floors, and cafe floors done in time when it’ll be me and one barista at 8 and we close at 9. this was also my first time doing the change order by myself, and while granted it’s not that hard, it still stressed me out. that was the first time i’ve cried at work since i was 18. i don’t even cry often, but that was such an awful shift.

the worst part is another shift talked about her concerns about anna with our sm and since anna is going away to school soon, there’s not much she can do. but the thing is, anna will be working at my store during breaks. she’s transferring as a shift to a starbucks near her college and i really hope she gets a rude awakening there. i work with her or get shifts handed off to me from her most of the time and it is so incredibly frustrating having to work twice as a hard in a position you’re still getting used to. it’s literally only like this with her. when i work with all the other shifts, they give me so much support and are always there to help me out if i need it. i just can’t wait until she leaves. one more week.",rant

1696,starbucks,"tldr: i cannot stand working with this one specific ssv. she is absolutely awful at her job.

i have been working at starbucks for 8 months and was promoted to ssv about a month ago, which was the second time i had interviewed. a couple of my shifts encouraged me to interview, but i wasn’t expecting to get it because at the time i had only been working there for 6 months. i thought it wouldn’t hurt to try though, so i gave it a shot. the first time i interviewed, i was not offered the promotion, but it was offered to this other girl, and let’s call her anna. i held no resentment towards anna when she was promoted because she had been working there longer than me (2+ years) and i thought she deserved it. 

i held no resentment until my shifts started telling me how they wish i had gotten it because she sucks at the job and when another shift told me my sm said the only reason i had not gotten it was because anna had more examples of coaching than me, and if i had had more, i would’ve gotten it over her. i still didn’t quite understand why they thought anna was a bad shift.

a month later i was promoted to ssv. all the ssvs that had worked with me during my practice shifts had told me that i was already better at the job than anna. i still didn’t understand why. i did thought get a little annoyed with her because she would just stand around doing nothing when there were clearly things to do and i had to instruct her on what to do when she should’ve been able to take initiative by herself. she’s not a green bean.

i finally understand why now that i’m working as an ssv alone. anna is not good at her job and is a pain to work with. she spends a lot of her time on the shift on her phone. when she is supposed to be doing the 3 hour pull, she is on her phone. she takes 20 minute breaks. she gives incredibly wrong information to the baristas. there was this one time she told all the baristas their 10 starts at the time it says on the ticket on their partner beverage they get on break.  so even if you’re waiting in line for 5 minutes to get a drink, your break doesn’t start until the time it says on the ticket. that is so incredibly not true (at least at my store). your break starts the time you step off the floor and now i have to correct every single barista she told this made up rule about.

her sense of urgency is so frustrating. she has none. we will be super behind on a crazy busy day and she will spend 10 minutes gossiping with the baristas instead of doing her job, which causes me to have to pick up her slack. it is so incredibly hard for me to get used to this position when i am doing two people’s jobs at once. she cannot read the room at all. i will be literally scrambling around trying to get tasks done or the pull done or do a restock and she will just follow me around telling me about her weekend plans or how she’s so excited for this one event coming up. it is so hard to not tell her to shut up, but i have resorted to just ignoring what she’s saying, looking at her, and saying to her “anna, do your job.” 

every shift she hands off to me is incredibly behind, even when there was no reason for it to be behind at all. 

there was one day they were super behind because it had been busy all day (it was double star day, i believe) and i came in at 4:30 . she lets me know all the barista tasks that were done (just foh floors and bathrooms) and rushes out of there. it was super behind and we were down a person as well. we didn’t get to starting syrups until about 6, when we usually start those around 4. the baristas and i somehow manage to get syrups, hot bars, cold bar, sinks, the pull, and milk count done by like 7:15. at 7:15, i decided i was going to count the drawers real quick because we need to get back floors done before we lose a barista at 8. i go to open the safe and the change order is sitting there in door 1 (it’s not even supposed to be in door 1). i was stressed out of my mind at this point because i couldn’t figure out how we were going to get a restock, back floors, and cafe floors done in time when it’ll be me and one barista at 8 and we close at 9. this was also my first time doing the change order by myself, and while granted it’s not that hard, it still stressed me out. that was the first time i’ve cried at work since i was 18. i don’t even cry often, but that was such an awful shift.

the worst part is another shift talked about her concerns about anna with our sm and since anna is going away to school soon, there’s not much she can do. but the thing is, anna will be working at my store during breaks. she’s transferring as a shift to a starbucks near her college and i really hope she gets a rude awakening there. i work with her or get shifts handed off to me from her most of the time and it is so incredibly frustrating having to work twice as a hard in a position you’re still getting used to. it’s literally only like this with her. when i work with all the other shifts, they give me so much support and are always there to help me out if i need it. i just can’t wait until she leaves. one more week.",rant

1715,starbucks,"my cafe only store has a double whammy of being a commuter store plus it’s in a tourist destination. during the week in the mornings, the customers are mainly professionals on their way to work or students on their way to school.  we are busy (usually hover between 45-70 transactions per half hour between 7:00-9:30ish am) but we get through the rushes quickly since the drinks are usually not too complicated and most customers usually order something for themselves. the rushes are also much easier to predict and it’s almost guaranteed to end at around 11 am each day. 

weekends are totally different. most customers come in large groups and families with large orders. or even a single person who comes in will order a whole bunch of food and multiple drinks. most drinks are complicated cold bar drinks with many modifications so it’s hard to get in a rhythm on bar, and then warming gets backed up to where we usually need two partners there. one partner to throw in the food and another to run it so we don’t run too far behind (if we are lucky to have the labor or not have call outs). we will only do maybe 50 transactions in a half hour tops but we will do over $600 in sales for that half hour. then we still remain very consistently busy until i clock out early afternoon. 

for some reason weekends mornings are very hectic and stressful in a way most weekday mornings aren’t. we just constantly feel behind on orders on weekends because of the complexity of the drinks and the massive food orders. it also seems like customers are more rude with us on weekend mornings as well. it’s almost guaranteed we will get some attitude from customers especially in those moments where we feel like we are drowning. it’s just so stressful and i dread weekend morning shifts. thankfully i only work saturdays and not sundays, so i only have to suffer once each week. but still, it’s just really rough.

i’ve worked for the siren for three years now in october and yet i feel like i have nothing to show for it. i excelled pretty quickly and was asked to be a trainer two weeks after i got hired and less than six months later did they ask for me to become an ssv. i loved my job for the longest time, a year into the company i went and opened up a store with my manager who is highly distinguished in the district and became her right hand man. i took it thinking it was going to be an amazing opportunity but it was nothing but heartache and stress on not only my work life but my home life as well. the first six months of that store being opened i was assaulted by a homeless man, robbed by a lady with a screwdriver (amongst other countless irf’s), and never felt appreciated or that i could ever be enough. the only thing holding me up was the green beans that looked up to me and trusted me with their safety because i never let them be put in harms way and did all i could to give them equal learning opportunities. i demoted pretty soon after and  i was promised an equal opportunity to be promoted again when i felt like my mental health was strong enough. i am the only one left at that store from the opening team including the manager and have now gone through 4  store managers in a year and a half. two months ago, i applied and interviewed to become an ssv again because of the raise and i missed being in control of the floor. i have done nothing but advocate for all partners to receive substantial training and help ssv’s with any customer or shift-related issues. during my interview, i asked my manager if there was any hesitations he had on re-promoting me and he said there was literally nothing he could think of besides possible availability issues. nevertheless, i did not get re-promoted and was told that i complained my entire interview about what they were doing wrong. the only thing i brought to his attention was the fact that most supervisors and barista‘s are trained to put cleaning tasks ahead of customers’ needs which results in lower customer satisfaction and higher drive times (with examples from literally that day!) i came in with a plan to resolve the majority of the issues at our store, but all he heard was that he and the other shifts weren’t doing enough. and honestly if i really were to complain during my interview, there’s no way in hell i would still have a job there. so here i am two months later still a barista who is now not even respected no matter how hard i work and no matter how much every single fucking person relies on me at that store(including the 3 brand new ssv’s he hired instead of me). i am the fastest, most efficient, and the most up-to-standard barista you will find in my store. that has been said by all store managers i have had and all baristas i have trained and mentored. but yet i have nothing to show for it and it truly sucks that i am going to have to find a new job and start all over again. i have not been bitter and have continued to support all who ask something of me but i feel like a kicked puppy who just runs back to their owner every time and i am at my wits end.",toddy-sized rant

1722,starbucks,"context. i am very new (2 weeks) working as a barista and i am a trans female.

sorry this is long, but it requires a big explanation.  
***tl:dr: pronoun pins make me feel more dysphoria/anxiety, i'm only wearing it because ""it's company policy,"" however many people in the store haven't been. i'm considering just leaving it off until told otherwise.***  


when i had my onboarding with my manager after getting hired they asked me my pronouns, and i gave them (she/her). afterwards i was handed all my noob items (apron, information packets, etc.), and they go ""...and here's your pronoun pin!""

my immediate response was, ""thanks, is this mandatory?"" at which point they told me that yes, it is the company policy.

first off, i was not about to argue or even question this my first day in the shop. as well, i support our non-binary partners and understand how pronoun pins really help customers gender them correctly, or other trans folks who may not immediately pass as the gender they identify as. i support inclusivity so i have worn it. 

now to explain why i don't like pronoun pins: i am binary, everything i do is to tell the world exactly what my gender is; female. i understand we live in a world with a spectrum of gender, but most people are binary, and i present that way. feminine makeup, long hair, skirts, feminizing surgeries from face to breasts, vocal feminization, etc, i present as femme as i can. but i do not completely pass. i am still working on my voice for example. its like 50/50 i get 'clocked' as mtf.

i don't dislike being trans, but i do not want the world to know i am. that said, for now i have zero problem with someone who misgenders me; i'm either too apathetic in the moment to explain or i can correct them gracefully, no biggie. but my entire goal in my journey is to forget i am trans, pass, and just be seen as a cis female. and with that, pronoun pins scream 'trans.' yes, more and more companies have employees' email signatures with a pronoun preference, and give options for people to wear pins or similar, but i have never been faced with \*having\* to explicitly announce my pronouns on my chest. it gives me anxiety i have not felt in four years, back when i looked like a man in a dress. before working here, i honestly thought it was just trans folks choosing to wear pronoun pins, and also, i dont recall seeing any cis folx or cis passing trans people wearing them ever.

one thing i did request was the same green pin everyone else had. i was given a white pin with big black letters that called more attention to it because our store was out of the she/her ones. green on green, less noticeable. in this moment i also explained all this to my manager; i am willing to do this since it's policy and for the sake of our other trans and/or nonbinary employees. i will say, my manager asked if i didn't want to wear it, and i just said again it's fine, because i'm brand new. i kinda forgot about it and have just been waiting for the green pin to show up.

now you may be thinking i'm being unprogressive, but please understand, the pin makes me think way too inwardly about myself and how i am perceived. finally, i wrote this post because today during my shift, no one was bothering to wear pronoun pins **except** for the nonbinary partner and other new girl. my trainer didn't have it on, my shift manager did not have theirs on, other partners didn't. just the new person and trans folx.  


\-

so, in closing, does everyone wear these pins in your store? do you think i should investigate if my manager will let me pass on it, being so new? i need to wash my apron tonight and i'm tempted to just not put the pin back on and say i lost it. i really don't like it. it's not like people don't wear white shoes (against policy), have shorts 6+"" above the knee (against policy), and wear earring bigger than a quarter or whatever the handbook said.

all things considered, i'm here for the trans health benefits and i will do whatever is necessary to do well at this job and get them. i work seven friggen days a week, i want my peers to like me, and i want to do a good job.

1747,starbucks,"today while i was on my lunch, with 2 hours left on my shift, i was about to clock back in, and i was blindsided by my manager telling me i was running the floor today during their shift meeting. too shocked to say anything i just followed orders while running a busy floor while trying to get our tasks done. this is the second or third time this has happened the exact same way, where i have been told with no prep time that i would be in charge as a barista, and had to run breaks and place other in their positions, etc.


i’ve expressed interest in a casual discussion about promoting about a year or so ago, but i made it expressly clear to my manager that i have no more interest as i’m in no position at home to do so, as i just got married and we have a new puppy and don’t believe i can commit to that responsibility, and i feel uncomfortable to do so as i feel awkward in a command position. even after expressly meeting with her, she still has me run the floor without warning. 


is this normal? if she knew that all the shifts and her would be unavailable for a meeting, should she have asked a shift supervisor from another store to cover for that time while they were meeting? i’m highly debating leaving a letter (since she doesn’t read her emails) saying how disrespected i feel, since she wants us to come to her with any and all complaints. this seems to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back for me as there have been other numerous experiences i’ve had with this manager/starbucks the company that has lead me to look for work elsewhere. 


am i validated to feel this way or am i overreacting?

i would’ve loved to work there but the hours i need to work at the research position along with my rigorous schedule as a full time student would make it incredibly difficult and i wouldn’t have the same availability as i did when i talked to the temporary manager.

1770,starbucks,"almost since its inception, starbucks has portrayed itself as a leader in eco-friendly business practices.  i had no reason to dispute that image until i became a frequent dine-in customer.  i first noticed their disingenuous portrayal when i found it a necessity to always keep a warm pull-over in my car just for my visits to starbucks, no matter the season.  i was not alone, as i observed others almost shivering, or making comments on the chilliness.  i would even see baristas wearing sweaters.   this was not a one store phenomenon, it was the case in virtually every starbucks i visited in atlanta.  

ten years later and a relocation, i don't find the same conditions exist (as much), however i went through considerable effort to bring this situation to the attention of starbucks management, in one case complaining by phone, to customer service, about a store blowing the ac while it was 55 degrees outside.   my beef on this point is that i calculated that starbucks, with its 25,000+ stores, was wasting energy, enough annually to power a small country.   and, that if every business entity followed their 'leadership' we'd be that much deeper into the climate change dilemma. 

now, post covid, as though it wasn't bad enough before, i find starbucks' behaving just as eco-unfriendly as ever.  while we all want to prevent the spread of viruses, we don't need to behave irrationally just to give the 'appearance' of doing so.  the biggest virus of all may the irreversible climate changes going on, to that end we should be making every effort to conserve energy consumption; which is done by optimizing the use of products created with energy generated out of climate damaging processes.   in this starbucks is one of the worst offenders. 

despite all my best efforts to have them conserve, not waste, in the course of serving even just me, their baristas are 'forced' to take numerous unneeded actions, to include the trashing of completely unused products, as if we were in a surgical unit.  they insist on putting tops on a cup i'm taking to my table, where then the top gets throw out.  they insist on putting cup sleeves on, even when i say it's unnecessary, which in seconds then go into the trash.  they insist on giving me my creme in a paper cup, again with another top, both of which go immediately into the trash.  no longer, like most places now, do they make use of self-serve canisters, more apparently due to customers who turn their coffees into lattes via the former mode.   

these 'policies' are not mere guidelines, with their 'aim' being their guide.  they are carried out without any thought as to propriety, by mindless robots.  it isn't as if i'm careless in regard to viruses.  for over twenty years i've been vigilant about not touching publicly handled surfaces.  the rhino virus would lay me up with brutally long coughing fits, and i knew i wouldn't be able to handle them as i got older.  my twice annual 'colds' almost disappeared.   thus, when covid came along, i was already use to the antiseptic mode in public.  

but, i use logic in the process of exercising each of my actions.  one of the steps i've taken, for two decades, is to handle any item like a credit/debit card by the edges when handed back to me by a store clerk.  retail clerks (including starbucks' staff) have handled many hundreds of such items from just as many people by the time i make my purchase.   

yet, with all of the purported virus safety actions they do every moment (which needlessly waste the energy used to produce them and add to landfills), when i look at the barista at my local starbucks, who has just swiped my starbucks 'rewards' card and is handing it back to me (virus laden), and i suggest to them that they (starbucks) make their credit card device capable of handling the 'rewards' card, they look puzzled.   or offer irrational excuses, like ""oh, that would take a new piece of equipment.""  to which, i would remark, ""yes, and other non-franchise starbucks have such equipment.""  some how, that evokes the response, ""they can do it, because they are a different company.""  ugh.  the obviously too bothered barista then offers, ""i can give you some anti-bacterial hand wash."" 

merely, suggesting that he/she pass the 'thought' along, gets a shrug, or a refrain about being powerless; this i get even from store managers.  

when placing an unused spoon, still in cellophane wrapper, upon the 'condiment' counter for possibly someone else's need, that same barista passing by immediately took it and threw it in the trash, seeming not to even care that i would catch it in my peripheral vision.  i could only grin.

1775,starbucks,"hey all,
i’ve been a partner for a little over a year. got promoted to ssv a few months ago. i transferred stores in order to get promoted.
honestly my manager is fine, and i like my coworkers at this store but i’m over the job. i was at a drive thru and now i’m at a cafe. the staffing just feels so uneven now with the smaller staff. even though it’s less busy, it felt easier to be at a busier store with more people working. also i used to work mid shifts, and now i’m closing all the time and i hate it. i’ve tried really hard to have a positive outlook and give myself time to adjust to the position, but it’s just not working for me. also i really dislike the customers at this new store. i’m used to incidents and karen’s and i can deal with that, but i feel like the average joe customers are just much more rude on a consistent basis. nothing major enough that i need to file an incident report, but enough that the lack of manners and respect has made the job a lot less enjoyable. 

overall, i’m just not happy with the job anymore. and while the pay increase i got from the promotion is nice, it’s still not worth it for me to stay here. i’d rather work somewhere i don’t actively dread on a daily basis.

i was wondering if anyone had tips/advice for quitting, since it’s not a super emergent situation. i know i’m waiting to say anything at least til that raise kicks in on the first, so i can say that was my last pay rate. also, i know that sick time doesn’t get paid out. i was planning on calling out after i put in my 2 weeks notice, but i read that can be considered leaving on bad terms. so i’m guessing i should use up a bunch of my sick time before i put in my 2 weeks notice.

today the barista working the window sees me behind another car (i could understand not knowing i was there, but she clearly saw me behind the car that ordered in front of me) and when i get to the window, she takes her sweet time getting to me then whips it open and snaps:

“you didn’t say anything at the box! you’re supposed to say something at the box!”

i calmly tell her that i’m just picking up a mobile order, too shocked to say anything else because of her snapping at me. she huffs off to find my order and comes back, practically throws it out the window st me, then slams the window shut in my face.

1806,starbucks,"background info: i've worked at my current store for almost 2 years. i am currently a barista trainer with open availability, i've never been reprimanded at all, and i'm never late or call out. there have been 2 instances that i've come to my store manager asking for help with certain situations (ss literally yelling at me while making me stay late after a close, to the point where it broke sb policy for minors, and when a ss who is the current main closer refused to use my correct pronouns/told coworkers that looking at me is ""like staring into a black hole, devoid of all emotion""). sm assured me that everything would be taken care of and apologised for their behaviour. there was over a year between complaints if that's relevant. 

at one point after this, i overheard sm telling current ss that i have a ""track record"" and not to worry about my complaint. this hurt, especially as sm has known me since i was 16 and ss had only been working at starbucks for 2 months at this point. i've overheard many, many, hurtful things said about me by ss and ignored them because of sm's response the first time. 

my store has recently lost 2 shift supervisors, one being a planned move by a closer, and one sudden loss (not death lol) of an opener.
because of this, our store manager (who typically opens) has been closing on specific days. i decided to apply for closing shift supervisor to help fill in the gaps, and had my interview with a store manager from a different store. 

everything went well, at least from what i've heard, but my store manager said that she will have to personally see me coaching my peers before she makes a decision. she will be coming in and watching me work for a few shifts, which is all fine and dandy, except for what she said after. 
she told me that she wouldn't be able to let me know if i got the job or not until the first week of september.
 i interviewed the day after i applied, at her request, because she said she'd rather do it sooner than later. i've seen multiple people become shifts from baristas and i've never seen or heard of this happening. i'm just not getting the right feeling from this situation.

i understand that supervisors need to be team players, positive, etc, and aside from the instances mentioned above, i can't think of a time where i've been anything less than that. i can't say for sure what the reasoning is behind this, but i do think it might be somewhat connected to the ss that has consistently been hostile towards me. is this common practice that she's just decided to enforce with me? i am a little too close to this to be able to see it objectively, and i'm aware i might just be overreacting, but i have bills to pay and i can't keep working 15 hours a week at 12 dollars an hour.

that said, my issue:

i am apparently the unluckiest motherfucker around, and despite being vaccinated and boosted, i tested positive for covid on june 6, at which time i used my self-isolation pay without any issues. 

now, 52 days later, i tested positive again, and am (mildly) symptomatic.

i have found coverage for all the shifts i was scheduled for during what should be my self-isolation timeline.

however my sm is saying that if a partner has another positive covid test within 90 days of an initial positive, self-isolation is not required, and therefore i cannot receive self-isolation pay (though i’m free to use sick hours.)

now, i believe that to be true for the sake of people who continue to test positive long after an infection, but what i’m experiencing now seems to be a new infection, and i am symptomatic, however mildly.

further, [this](https://stories.starbucks.com/stories/response-to-covid/) message says that partners may use two rounds of self-isolation pay per quarter. a quarter is 90 days. it does not stand to reason that i would not be required to isolate this time around.

i don’t want to call partner resources on her, but she said this morning when i brought that message to her attention that she would make some calls and get back to me by the end of the day. she hasn’t, and i would like whatever clarification and/or advice you folks have to offer.

1828,starbucks,"hi, tomorrow will be my third day working at starbucks. 
i have a pretty busy store and i’ve honestly had to pick up things pretty quickly. i just wanted to share my experience and ask for any advice before i go in for my third day tomorrow.

1. so on my second day i did training in the morning with a trainer over customer/store support and then was scheduled for a coverage shift in the evening on what i’ve learned. i was honestly very overwhelmed since this was my second day and i didn’t understand the whole coverage/training shifts. at first i didn’t really understand what i was suppose to do, i was constantly asking the other baristas if they needed anything and felt kind of like a burden, at one point i just refilled ice, refilled cups,and hid in the back trying to figure out what to do. i had to work 12:00- 3:30pm that day by myself and i was already dreading this part of training as i felt under-prepared. i ended up asking once of the veteran baristas if she needed anything anything and she started giving me a few tasks that would help the store, i ended up making lemonade, refilling the açaí refresher, one of the baristas asked me if i knew how to refill the tea packets which i responded no to and she showed me where the tea was was and where they went, i even refilled the coffee kegs that contain the cold brew with the help of an experienced barista. the supervisor even ended up showing me how to know how much milk goes into each fridge and giving me reminders on the recipes of whipping cream, vanilla cream and how much goes into each. i honestly still feel like i was still unprepared to work a coverage shift alone but i’m glad it ended up working out and i had a great time.

i wanted to ask a few questions to the experienced and inexperienced baristas on how working their first shift alone went and ask some questions about the customer/support role.

1. can someone explaining the brewing process, i’m still confused about how the brewing process works and why we brew; i’ll be asking my trainer to go over this tomorrow so i just wanna make sure i have everything done since i feel like it wasn’t explained that well?
2.  is it normal to be working a coverage shift my second day, it seemed like a lot people were shocked since they didn’t really know what i would be doing since i didn’t really know how to do anything, it’s so much different learning about skills and then actually doing them on the floor.
3. does everyone date things differently, i learned how to date things differently with my trainer and i felt everyone dates items different. can someone explain the correct way to do it. here’s an example on how i was taught to date things. if the whipped cream expires in 24 hours and todays date is 7/28 i’ll grab a friday sticker and put the date 7/29 and will be discarded at 9pm. can someone give insight on this? 
4.  can you guys share your experience working at starbucks your first week? i didn’t enjoy working without a trainer; i’ve never felt that overwhelmed on my second day. hopefully throughout this week and next i’ll my trainer by my side and i’ll make sure i clarify any concerns i have.

any tips and advice to a novice barista would be helpful, especially if anyone has any links to any quizlets, flash cards or helpful material that will help prepare me for my next week working on hot/cold bar, cash register and ovens. thank you!","starbucks first week of training, questions and concerns?"

but most of the sweetness/vanilla is supposed to come from some number of pumps of that same vanilla syrup before even adding the cream right? 

i mean-- one recipe i read here suggested for a single serving to use 3 tbsp heavy cream, 2 tbsp 2% milk, and 1tbsp vanilla. this wouldn't be very sweet, but it would also be far above the calories of a single serving for a tall if i put exactly this amount in my coffee lol

i can start by saying that i have two regulars who order their food in very particular ways, and we've named it after them amongst ourselves. you can order a bagel (customer name)-style and we'll know what you mean. 

i also really like making shaken drinks. it's just fun and satisfying. i love when someone orders two of the same refresher at the same time, so i make both of them in different shakers, and i shake them both at the same time. i feel like some funny anime character.

i like when someone orders an iced mocha and i pour the espresso over the syrup and mix them as the espresso pours. i think its really satisfying to blend them that way.

i like putting a dome lid on a frappuccino and then adding the whip

i like when someone orders a specific drink that i like

i like when someone asks me what i'd recommend and listens

i like when someone orders a drizzle around the cup. i think it's fun to do.

i like when someone comes in with a dog and i offer them a pup cup and they say yes and then i get to watch the dog get excited and eat it

i like talking to children and their parents. i like watching parents help their kids figure out their order and how to ask for it. and on the flipside, i like trying to help a parent figure out what their kid wants. i had a parent come to me and politely tell me about how their kid wasn't happy with their drink, so we figured out what the problem was and remade the drink. i'm so happy to do things like that. i actually do like making people happy even if this job can test my limits.",i need some positivity

1856,starbucks,"hi y'all, currently at my store there is a situation where i think i am being bullied and i'm not sure what to do. 

a shift supervisor in my store doesn't like me and at first i thought it was all in my head. i will refer to him as orange for anonymous purposes. 

orange tends to glare at me while we are working a lot. he doesn't really talk to me in a friendly way like he does with others and one time we got into an argument regarding my lunch. ever since this argument,he treats me differently. there are times when it's very busy and he decides to put me on bar by myself despite me asking for help. one time i was scheduled for clean play with orange and orange didn't help me with anything. i did all the cleaning,i closed the store, i did nearly everything by myself and all he did was stay in the back and do the ""count"" and ""pull"" for hours. eventually we got out very late and he told me ""this was not okay,i feel like we need to do better than this"" i was so exhausted mentally and physically and i was genuinely shocked he told me this after i did everything. i broke down crying in the parking lot in my car, i just got so overwhelmed. i gave him the benefit of the doubt and ignored this.

2 weeks ago, i signed up for a double shift but i felt awful while working. i felt very nauseous and my head hurt a lot so once my morning shift was over,i clocked out and i headed home. once i was home, i thought maybe resting for a bit would fix how i was feeling. it didn't so i called in and let orange know i wasn't feeling well and couldn't come in. he said okay and told me to find coverage. i used my sick time for this and wrote it in the punch communications log. a few days after, a barista let me know that orange was saying he didn't believe i was sick and he thinks i was just trying to get extra time without working.

out of curiosity i checked the book and it turns out someone had crossed out what i wrote with black sharpie. i immediately contacted my store manager and she said she didn't do that. i didn't do it and i thought it was probably orange. i told my manager that i was being targeted and that i felt unsafe and paranoid. i specifically told her i feel like this was an attack and she dismissed my feelings. she continuously kept telling me it was just a misunderstanding. she told me she fixed this and i got my sick time but some shift supervisors let me know she said in a meeting they had that i actually did not get my sick time at all. in this same meeting,orange actually confessed to crossing my name out with sharpie. he said he did it because he thought i wrote it there by mistake?? my manager completely ignored my feelings and allowed this to happen. 

where do i go for help to correct this? what do i do? :( i feel like i'm being targeted by orange and that i'm not being heard at all by my manager. i was thinking of transferring maybe. please comment any advice or resources. i printed a few documents to read if any of this is allowed or what rules specifically this breaks.",help

at this store it seems like my warming supports main job is to just get in my way. i’m not allowed to put stickers on the rack, i have to immediately put them on a bag. my warming support does nothing but move the stickers and put them in a cute little corner on the bag. they put pastry stickers on bags and then set them behind me and then run food.

she told me she's never had this problem before. i told her that usually we put extra ice in the cup, so it looks full, but it's really just mostly ice, and that light ice means the cup won't be filled. if someone filled the cup for her with light ice before, they were making it wrong. i told her her options were for me to charge her for a latte or for her to take it. did not look happy when i said the drink was gonna be like 6-7 dollars.

yesterday i was on bar, and i had this mobile order come in for a shaken espresso with a ton of different modifications on it. it was terrifying to look at, but i thought, “what the hell, i like a challenge.” i did it super slowly, and i was triple checking i got all the steps right, and then i finished the drink. it had several layers, and i was pretty freaking proud of it.

a few minutes later, the barista on drive thru went to get the drink i made, and he said over the headset, “op, did you make this mobile order?” my first thought was “ah, shit, i screwed up somehow” because usually when someone asks if i was the one who made a drink they have something to say about it, like it having drizzle when it wasn't supposed to or it looking too dark or i didn't layer it correctly. another barista thought this too, because she was on her way to to grab the sticker off the drink so she could go ahead and remake it herself.

but then, he said ""no, i just wanted to say this looks beautiful."" and it made my freaking day, because a lot of the baristas at my location had been super rude to me for not knowing/remembering certain things and messing up, so a compliment on a super hard drink was something i needed. just wanted to share, because even though i'm still screwing up all the time, and it'll take a while before i fully earn my coworkers' respect, i am improving and stuff like this really inspires me to keep going.",finally getting the hang of it!

i know shaken espressos exclusively get 1/2 pumps but if i sweetened a tea with lcs i would use the 1/2 pump and for a venti for example i’d do 6 half pumps but if they want it sweetened with raspberry do i do 6 full or 3 full to equal 6 half pumps. also what does the customer want when they are asking about extra pumps in shaken espressos? for example, they want 3 pumps of toffee nut in like a shaken espresso, do they want 3 full pumps or 1.5 full pumps to equal the standard pump for a shaken espresso?",training new baristas

1887,starbucks,"i keep coming across videos on tiktok about customers drinks not being filled up all the way and then when they show the drink it’s a fkin shaken espresso.

for more details: this specific person said they wanted light ice and light milk and complained on tiktok showing us that their venti sized drink was half full expecting more coffee.

first of all: why tf is it always the shaken espresso?

second of all: does nobody know the difference between regular drip coffee and espresso? like what makes you think the barista is gonna fill up your shaken espresso with more espresso because you wanted more “coffee”? if you wanted more coffee then pay for the extra shots. 

third of all: you wanted light ice. the espresso is gonna melt that. and then you wanted light milk .. so ofc it’s not gonna be filled up all the way. 

i swear to god people don’t know what they’re ordering and to make it worse they embarrass themselves on tiktok for the world to see then they say all the baristas who were correcting them were “projecting” onto them. proves that customers will bitch and take things personally and then they go karen mode for no reason.",shaken espresso complaints on tiktok

the good news is i was able to transfer despite three write ups (i had to fight for it), and this new store has just been such a blessing. its far from the perfect starbucks, but the team is great. i am never made to feel less for my disability, and most important of all i dont feel like im taken advantage of as a means to provoke a negative reaction out of me thats worthy of another write up/separation. the team actually suggested i try again with my appeal, because no one understands how i have three corrective actions. so i drafted up another appeal. and this one is 5 pages. its still a draft, but... should i even try? can i get fired for trying to clear my record? for constantly trying to get my ex sm thoroughly investigated? (they go on vacation everytime theyre supposedly being investigated and it comes back inconclusive! like no shit it did!)

anyway…

i took the next car &amp; as they literally snatched their drink from my hand *almost dropping the hot coffee* they said “i saw the dog lick your hand, that’s disgusting you need to wash your hands right now. i cant believe how gross you are.” 
so i nicely told him it was my coworker and that she is currently washing her hands before returning to work. he cut me off to say “she needs to be fired you can’t touch dogs. it’s unsanitary.” then just drove off angrily.

now two things really bother me about this:
1. the obvious, being that of course we always wash our hands if we pet a dog or touch trash or any of that. cleanliness standards are important to uphold 
2. if he was paying that much attention he should’ve noticed that the hand/arm petting the dogs was covered in tattoos, while my arms/hands have no tattoos at all.

it’s something about just being so rude about it that boils my blood. he could’ve just been like “hey i saw what looked like you touching a dog, did you happen to wash your hands before grabbing my drink?”

we've even had customer complaints that the drink isn't the same. 
why would starbucks not test this milk? if we took a picture of the drink now it would just look like an iced latte.

i’ll start - it’s hard to choose a favorite partner since i genuinely enjoy working with all of them. but my supervisor (or assistant manager? idk lol), “electron,” really stands out. electron greets customers loudly while helping out behind the bar and regularly pushes me to be the best i can be, frequently checking in to make sure that we’re on the same page and she’s not pushing too hard. my favorite thing is how she greets and sends customers off - “have a great day on purpose!!” or “happy monday! you woke up today and that’s awesome!!” might sound a little cheesy or overly optimistic to you, but if you experienced electron’s attitude in person, you’d get it. sometimes she can get an entire tense, backed-up cafe to laugh out loud.

my favorite customer is easier to choose, even though there are a bunch of really cool ones. “neutron” comes in everyday, walks up to the register, looks you dead in the eye, and says “tall. pike. black.” he punctuates each word and says nothing else. maybe it sounds rude to you, but i get the sense that eye contact and interacting with strangers is something he had to work at early on in life, and the way he orders always strikes me as cute, and it makes me happy to see him (not just because his order is easy!!). neutron’s is the first face, name, and order i learned by heart.

now, at the new location, my drink is at least half foam. i asked the barista why my drink was half foam and she said that's how they are supposed to be.

so, is that true? i don't mind a little foam at the top but when half my cup is foam, i feel like my $6 drink is a ripoff.

i was talking to the other new person and they noticed they just don’t like me. i’ve been always taught to be polite no matter what, and yet they shove into me, not even avoiding me when it’s literally an open space, yell at me when i can’t hear someone in drive 1 time out of 50 other people, keeps telling me to do a specific thing a specific way when i already do, they never apologize either and are never kind when i am asking a question about how to do something or a reminder, they yank stuff out of my hands so quickly and aggressively it scares me sometimes

2035,starbucks,"ok so let me try to explain this. something i always have trouble with, is when people put me on a pedestal when im just being myself. 

from the outside looking in, i understand why people put me there. i am young, i speak articulately, im not ugly, im getting my masters, im mature/not petty or vindictive, im also mild mannered/can be quiet, i don't really have any responsibilities outside of going to work part time and school, i have a very ""she has her life organized"" type of energy, most importantly im a nice person with a positive aura. by no means perfect, i am very lucky/blessed but i also was taught how to work hard and i do.  i understand how i appear to the outside world. 

sometimes when i go to work with people (adults) who have a lot more on their plate and who life hasn't been that kind too, i start to feel guilty when they put me on this pedestal. they see me going about my business and its like because of how i present my self, im either treated like an alien, an angle or like i'm a problem child. honestly if someone has a problem with me i genially don't care and will peacefully avoid them. but when people put me on a pedestal and say things like ""wow your sooo happy"", or ""well you don't really have problems"", or ""i wish i could be upbeat like you"", i get so tongue tied and don't know how to respond to this stuff. i don't enjoy the treatment, mostly because i suspect that when i leave the room there is much negative talk about me. it just makes me feel so weird and awkward because from my perspective im not doing anything spectacular, but yet it's treated as something abnormal. inside i think "" sorry im not as miserable as the majority!"". 

i just want to come in do my job, collect my pay and get out. im not interested in being perfect or making people feel inferior (without even really doing anything). some of my coworkers are very negative people and make fun of my upbeat mannerisms. i don't like when they do this, but i don't want to get on anyones bad side and create an even more negative environment.

how does one handle this situation? can anyone else relate? how do i not feel guilty/move on from these interactions?

any advice would be much appreciated. thank you so much.","how to not feel guilty around negative older coworkers, when they think i have no problems? how to handle being put on a pedestal for being ""happy""?"

2049,starbucks,"before i go on about my rant, i would like to say that mental health is real and important, and i mean no offence to anyone with any psychological issues/ health conditions. 

as a newly hired external ssv, i learnt soon after starting working that my store has an extraordinary amount of partners dealing with mental health issues; partners with depression, anxiety, panic attacks ad nervous breakdowns every now and then. 

again, i do not mean to be a dickhead but why do i have to deal with their mood-swings, mental breakdowns, tantrums and anxiety attacks while i’m on the floor making sure that things run well? i’m not a psychologist or a psychotherapist and i certainly do not have a masters degree in dealing with partners that are mental health patients?????

anything and everything i say to them and around them is taken out of proportion, they get offended easily or i end up having to give literal therapy sessions while on the floor, as some partners start having mental breakdowns while working and others start feeling a sense of inadequacy and incompetence. i can’t even compliment other partners for their good work without these partners going, “why don’t people ever say good things about me” and “i am sorry i am doing my best but i just suck”.

all of this has been taking a toll on my own mental health, feeling the need to fix everything and help everyone feel good about themselves while trying to stay sane myself. i can’t help but question why i have to go out of my way to help these partners function well on the floor, while starbucks continues to hire more and more partners dealing with similar mental health issues without providing us supervisors with any specific training to help us work more effectively while working with partners that are dealing with mental health issues. welp",i probably sound like a dickhead venting about this but my mental health also exists and it too is taking a beating.. :(

2056,starbucks,"karens are awful and all but nothing grinds my gears more than partners who are awful to other partners at stores they don't work at. 

this happened a while ago but i need to get it off my chest, one time some woman came through the drive thru n had this long ridiculous order w like 2 trenta teas w 14 pumps of syrup minimum in each one, 7 food items and a bag of coffee beans. she got to the window n was super rude, complaining about the wait time n all. she waited until the payment already went through and she was given most of her stuff to ask if she could use her partner numbers to mark out the coffee. threw a fit n made the barista on window ring up the whole order all over again just to mark out the stupid beans. 

when we were done ig it still wasn't over, cuz she decided to turn into our parking lot, open the door, take one of the trenta teas w 37364 syrup pumps she paid for, take off the lid and dump it all on our parking lot

she took off after that n my manager had to go out w a pitcher of hot water to run over the whole mess which was already starting to seep down the slight hill toward the street

i can't understand how anyone, let alone someone working for the same company, could do that to a bunch of minimum wage workers just trying to get by. you'd think she would be humbled by the karens she deals w on a daily basis, but ig she assimilated to become one instead.",honestly
2057,starbucks,"omg i completely forgot to post this on reddit so here goes! 
this happened on friday i think but a lady comes to the box and says she has a reward (i can’t remember which one) but it needed to be mobile ordered to receive the points. so she orders her drink in the drive thru and pulls out of the drive thru. so of course the ticket comes through and i make it. a few minutes go by and the drink is just dying so we got rid of it. later on after i was taken off bar and she apparently mobile ordered her drink, drank it in the cafe, and finished it, she comes to the register and asked why the drink was bitter or not sweet. let me just give y’all a rundown on what she ordered: 
a venti iced americano w/ 4 splenda and a splash of whole milk. it literally has water in it and if i’m not mistaken splenda isn’t like sweet sweet yk? it has sort of an aftertaste to it. anywho she has finished the drink so me and the shift are puzzled by what she wants us to do with this now. she doesn’t want a refund or a refill and she can’t get it remade bc it’s just ice bc she completely finished it, she wants to know why her own order isn’t sweet when we put exactly what she ordered in her drink. it took her the whole drink the realize it wasn’t sweet??? as we are telling her this over and over we are getting nowhere. she literally just wanted to create a problem with the drink. ffs.",asking for a remake (?) after finishing the entire drink.
2058,starbucks,"i hate when customers stand at the handout and watch me make drinks. yesterday i was on cafe/mobile bar, and i was making somebody’s iced coffee order. i had multiple mobile &amp; cafe orders. this older lady ordered an iced americano and stood there watching me make drinks. the iced coffee order called for almond milk, and as i started pouring it in, the americano lady started yelling “no i said regular milk! dont put that in there!”.  i just stared at her for a second. then she said, “is that my order?”. “no…”.  -_-",can you go sit down?

2070,starbucks,"i work at a starget (target starbucks) and i closed last night. 42 seconds before closing, i kid you not, a lady walks up. ""are you closed?"" she asked.

swallowing my anger, i said, ""in less than a minute."" now, usually people are apologetic, and i expected her to be the same and leave. but she did nothing of the sort.

instead, she ordered five shots of espresso in a venti cup with vanilla, extra ice, heavy cream, and whipped cream. 

when i asked her ""will that be all?"" she proceeded to order a grande java chip frappuccino and question me on what type of iced coffee is my favorite and what do i recommend.

at that point, it was 4 minutes past closing, and i still hadn't made any of her drinks yet because she decided to play 20 questions. i tried not to be rude,  (probably failing due to my facial expressions which were no doubt unamused) but i had lots of things to get done, and since i work alone most the time i had no extra hands to help me. 

isn't it rude to walk in less than a minute before a place closes and order multiple drinks? if it was water or just even a refresher, it would've been a little different since those are very quick. i'd never do that to someone, it just doesn't seem very polite.","seconds before closing, a woman walks up..."
2071,starbucks,"hey folks, i'm feeling really upset by an experience i had today and feel like i need to get it off my chest. i've been working here for 1.5-ish years and have never had a customer treat me this nasty. any listening ear is deeply appreciated. 

these people pulled up to the speaker, so i hit em with the solid, ""welcome to starbucks, what can i get started for you?"" and was met w silence. hit them with another ""weeeelcome to starbucks, what can i get for ya today?"" ..more silence. waited another minute and said, ""order whenever you're ready!!"" a minute passes and i hear some giggling. before i'm able to try to greet again, they scream ""hello????"" into my headset. i, albeit a little irritably, answer ""...hello? order when you're ready."" they order a few drinks, one of which is a ""caramel cookie crumble"" - i know i'm in the wrong for not clarifying. i should have. but, i just rang them up for a mocha cookie crumble + called it a day. it matched more and i didn't wanna talk to them anymore. 

when they pull up to the window they're pissed because we forgot whip on one of their iced coffees. they're pretty rude about it, rolling their eyes and pulling faces at me, but i just bite my tongue and put the whip on it to get them out quicker. i hand out the mocha cookie and the person in the passenger seat is immediately yelling at me that it isn't right, isn't what they ordered, i screwed up again (almost verbatim - ""you messed my drink up""). i say, ""i'll remake it for you, sorry. you said caramel cookie crumble at the speaker, so i took a guess."" as i'm remaking it for them, they take the liberty to scream ""caramel ribbon crunch. caramel ribbon crunch. i want a caramel ribbon crunch. you hear me?"" at me while i remake the drink. i hand them the drink and the person in the passenger seat goes (venemously, of course), ""have a blessed day."" i told them to have the day they deserved and heard them scream in rage as they drove off. i didn't know people acted like that in real life. 

i admit that i probably could have been nicer, but i'm really tired of pretending like i don't have emotions and that people can just treat me like garbage with no consequence. i know i'm preaching to the choir here, but please just be nice to your baristas. we're people too.",why do people suck ? ? - venti rant

2075,starbucks,"
as i have received the green light from the department to share the idea i had for the starbucks company, i will go ahead and describe what came to mind.
so, seeing as there are a lot of patrons that love their daily dose of caffeine before heading to work in the morning, or after a long day at the office, the idea came to mind after seeing the star system only allows you to get a drink each 150 stars, unlike some other competitors, you can get a free drink without having to spend 150$, 75$ or if you time it right with double star points and double stars per reload, it can be as low as 37.5$ 
that is still too much for people if you really think about it! per free drink i mean
so, my idea is to set up a beverage club, a special card customers will receive as soon as they sign up, with their very own member number that they can use while waiting for the card to arrive in the mail, they pay monthly, for a fee, say 60$ a month, that’s 2$ per drink, still lower than the 6$ venti people usually get! they get to use this card once a day to receive one free drink per day, any additional drinks that same day will be charged normally, but the beverage club will have a large success and i really see it blooming, i for one would love to see a beta version of this and see how many people would love to have it! 
maybe send out a survey and if it reaches a certain number of interested people maybe launch it! 
the club could be named “the starbucks insiders club” the name blooming from the fact that each person that would sign up for this club would be considered a member of the inside inner circle of starbucks patrons
man, i should really be a partner",the idea
2076,starbucks,idk what it is but everything is so garbled. i know everyone doesn’t have the whole menu memorized and that everyone won’t be super comfortable with ordering for a number of reasons but i can’t hear the majority of people that come through anymore. is it just me? most people are mumbling or just speaking really low or trailing off at the end or adding weird unnecessary train of thought details. i like doing dto but i’m really struggling to just get a clear order out most days especially with all the ways you can customize a drink with starbucks.,i can’t hear what people are saying in drive anymore

but idk the oatmilk one almost always comes out well, maybe in part 'cause the blonde espresso doesn't get as bitter. i'm so happy they decided to formulate new shaken espresso recipes, i was kinda surprised at the time because it's not like the doubleshot was ever particularly popular. but they actually nailed it!",brown sugar oatmilk shaken espresso appreciation thread

strawberry açaí lem.
- no strawberry inclusions
- no lemonade

my whole team was completely baffled, to the point where we started arguing over what we thought it meant. 

the initial thought was to put water. but, if they wanted water they would’ve picked refresher and not lemonade. the other option was to put all base into it. but we didn’t really want to do that because we would run out faster than planned. the problem with this order was there was 2 of them. and they were venti’s.

after 5 minutes of all of us thinking about it we decided to just do it and give them all base. but we all mutually agreed if it said no ice we would’ve given them the correct amount of base for a venti and left the rest of the cup empty. 

after thinking about it more, i want to know what other people would do about this. only partially fill the cup with the ice? we didn’t think about this one at the time because our manager says to always fill the cup unless they intentionally order it as “_ in a _ cup”",how would you make it?

this means i cannot apply for a promotion or transfer when i need to for the sake of my mental, physical, and financial health.

2111,starbucks,"my coworkers have developed a habit of opening up inclusion bags and not putting the berries into the inclusion containers — they just free-pour the berries into drinks.

i completely understand that it’s an annoying added step to put the berries in the container (especially during rush) and that sometimes the spoons get wet so the containers/berries get all gross and stuff.

but imo you just have to suck it up, clean it, and be more careful not to get liquid into the cases. personally, i find it a bit annoying to always have to free-pour the berries. sometimes it’s a struggle to find where the last person put the bag, and it tends to make drinks (especially mdr) inconsistent.

in my free time, i’ve been putting the berries into the containers, but my coworkers are so used to just free-pouring from the bag that they keep opening up new inclusion bags even though there are berries in the containers 🫤

it’s not the end of the world to free-pour, but i personally would just prefer to use the spoons. what do you guys think? aita?",the inclusion containers exist for a reason…

2153,starbucks,"the production and disposal of single use items like disposable cups bring several negative impacts on the environment, such as global warming and pollution. here are five reasons why these cups are so problematic: 

1. with coffee being the most popular beverage in america, over 100 billion cups are used every year.
2. 25 billion foam cups are consumed annually – they´re made of non-biodegradable petroleum-based plastic (polystyrene/styrofoam), containing toxic chemicals that can threaten human and animal health.
3. 58 billion paper cups are thrown away annually – most of them are plastic coated cups, which means they’re non-recyclable. 
4. 20 million trees are cut down and 12 billion gallons of water are used every year in order to make paper cups.
5. every four cups create 1 pound of co2 emissions.

in addition, paper, plastic and styrofoam cups cause the depletion of resources and add to the global landfill crisis.

how could that possibly be changed? by making paper cups recyclable, which means big companies like starbucks changing the plastic coated cups to eco-friendly alternatives. 

any thoughts on that?

i do call out sometimes that’s just how it is with the things going on in my life but not enough to be an issue where my coworkers are always left hanging. i also always stay extra when they ask or will come in early the second they ask me too. which that’s almost always because my manager either doesn’t schedule enough people or two people called out the same day. some of my other coworkers call off all the time and one of them literally just hasn’t been showing up but i have attendance issues ?? like her name on the line chart today just had a question mark by her name and she was opening.

2178,starbucks,"hi all, 368 here,

i have some ideas for mobile ordering that i believe would significantly better streamline the process and make things a lot easier for baristas. here's what i'm thinking:

1. **drink limits.** customers are to order no more than 5 beverages per order, and they cannot order any more from their starbucks account until they have picked up their first order.
2. **food limits.** warming baristas need help too! i recommend no more than 5 items total, and no more than two of one *type* of item (especially breakfast sandwiches) and able to be batched in groups of two per warming bag, where applicable. 
3. **customization limits.** customers cannot make more than 5 customizations to a beverage, particularly extra syrups and inclusions. along with this may be additional fees for specifications such as light/extra ice, blonde instead of signature, and extra pumps instead of the baseline amount per size.
4. **delivery order limits.** delivery customers should be allowed no more than, i think, 6 beverages and 6 food items. if delivery customers need more than 6 of either item, they will need to call the store ahead of time. and no cheating, either; they should only be able to call and order from one store only.
5. **(\*cafe only\*) no more than 5 iced or hot drinks per person.** a person should be allowed, at max, only 10 beverages, or 5 each hot and/or iced. any more and then they will have to make a separate transaction after receiving their first batch, or else have another person in their party make an order for themselves. i think the same limit of 5 items should be imposed for heated food, too.

i just was promoted to ssv a couple weeks ago and i get massive anxiety going to work now. i am so afraid of fucking up or having a bad shift and afraid that i am causing a bad shift for the baristas. i’m a closer and there’s this one morning shift that is so knit picky about every close and am terrified of what she might say about my close (she also literally has never closed before and i don’t think she actually understands how much there is to do at night and what it’s like). 

also the night crew at my store tends to be majority green beans, so it doesn’t help that i have to balance doing my shift tasks and basically walking all of my baristas through their shift and through closing. there’ll occasionally be at least 1 seasoned barista and the majority of the seasoned baristas will take initiative by themselves to do closing tasks and walk green beans through them and give them things to do, which helps a lot, but i then worry that they think i’m a bad shift because i should be doing that. 

i worry that my fellow shifts think i’m a bad shift.  tonight i screwed up the change order and now the safe is $100 over. my sm assured me it was fine and she would fix it, but i feel so much guilt and my fellow shift assured me that i wouldn’t get in trouble, especially because it wasn’t my responsibility as a closing shift to do the change order because the mid shift was supposed to do it. i’m trying to give myself some leeway because it was my first time doing it alone and things were hectic so i was stressed and messed up the counting, but i can’t stop telling myself i’m so stupid for screwing that up. 

i’m not sure if this is a good fit for me, but i don’t want to step down because i need the money. i’m upset that this isn’t going as well as i thought it would because i was a really good barista and i thought i could do it and i never ever believe in myself, so the one time i did, it turned out i was wrong. i go to bed and my heart won’t stop pounding and i can’t stop shaking and my thoughts won’t stop racing. it’s hard to sleep at night because of the intense amount of shame and guilt i feel.

we also had the ssv crafting experience training today with shifts from two other stores and i had an anxiety attack because of the immense pressure i feel to perform well from other shifts, baristas, my sm, my dm, and myself. it was embarrassing because everyone noticed i wasn’t okay, even the shifts from the other stores. they were all very concerned and even a couple of the shifts i don’t know from the other stores asked me if they could do anything to help me, which i appreciated, but i hate looking weak. it was embarrassing. i haven’t had an anxiety or panic attack in a year.",promotion is worsening my mental health

in my training i was told to just listen to what they have to say and “make it right” by removing the charges and making the drinks as requested. is this legit? is there another way to handle this? should i tell them they’re literally getting an iced white mocha and that i have to charge them for that?

any who! before working here at my target starbucks, i always considered all employees who worked for this company or at least under its name a starbucks partner/barista.  i want to know more about this over a larger scale and hear all of your opinions.

sooo, what are your opinions about target starbucks employees? do you consider them a part of the starbucks team or do you think of them more as a part from the business? do any of you work at a target starbucks and enjoy your job or hate it completely? and what got you to the point of finally quitting the job?!",baristas! what do you think of target starbucks?

2228,starbucks,"i quit sbux a few  months ago and this suddenly came up in my head recently. i would always get my drinks with whole milk and the amount of crap i got for it was mind blowing. 99% of the time i'm getting a quad blonde iced latte with 2 pumps of flavoring, maybe with cold foam every once in a while. multiple coworkers would gag at my drinks, tell others that ""he probably downs a gallon of heavy cream once he goes home"", and one person even asked me if i've ever ""pulled a homelander."" (if you've seen the boys, they were referring to that scene in s3 where he milks a cow and then just immediately drinks it). but jesus christ. if you've ever been to a local or **real** coffee shop, there is a reason they are probably using whole milk as the default. if you've ever seen an actual professional barista, there is a reason they are probably using whole milk for most of their drinks. actual coffee culture uses whole milk as its default because it both tastes best in drinks and steams best for art. there is a crapload of science behind this but no one ever cares because ""it's just an excuse for being disgusting."" starbucks is barely a coffee shop at best, and that is not a jab at the employees. this company just does a poor job training and teaching its employees and has many serious changes to make before it can even be close to an actual café.

for the record, i am not bullying lactose intolerant people whatsoever, if you can't or don't want to drink dairy milk, no one is asking you to.  if you don't like dairy or don't want to use lactaid, there is absolutely no reason to shat yourself or drink something you don't like, that's why alternatives exist in the first place.

&amp;#x200b;

but holy hell. just stop. just because i like getting my drinks (***in my opinion***, and obviously many other's) the **proper** way, does not mean i'm some disgusting freak. i don't bully you for not being able to handle dairy, so don't bully me just because i like it. i see this happen way too often (mostly at starbucks), and with many other people who just don't know too much about coffee culture. that is all. just don't be a dick. the end.",psa: stop bullying your coworkers for getting dairy milk

anyways, i’ll for the past year i’ve been preparing for an international competition relating to this other commitment, but i received my schedule for that recently and now there’s a schedule conflict (i have at one shift that def needs to be covered as i’ll already be in another state by then, and another that i can technically make but would rather not since it ends half an hour before i’m supposed to leave.) 

i would have talked to my store manager sooner but today was the absolute earliest i could get in contact with her since this conflict came up. i’ve already offered up both shifts as well as talked to pretty much all other partners at my store but it looks like everyone is either already working or just busy, and now i’m completely stuck. 

is it possible for me to ask around for partners at other stores to see if they can cover the shift? it’s starting to look like my only other option is to quit but i really don’t want to do that for everyone’s sake and i don’t even know if that’ll work. 

i know i reallyyy should have planned better but i’m completely desperate right now so if anyone has any other i would so gladly take it. i really don’t want to mess things up for anyone but this extracurricular is something that i’ve been doing for over ten years and i know it sounds super selfish but i always prioritize it above pretty much everything in my life. thanks so much in advance!",is it possible to ask a partner from another store to cover a shift

i had a huge sense of relief knowing this raise was coming. not only can i take some of the financial burden off of my partner, but i can save some too in case of emergencies?!

i use my last name at work, because i'm nonbinary/trans and i haven't yet decided on any other name and i like my last name. it's not even anything quirky, just a somewhat uncommon last name that i use on my name tag. the interaction went a little something like this:

customer (like a middle aged-ish woman): is that really your name? 

me: yes! i use my last name at work.

customer: pfft- really?? hahaha 

customer, muttering to another middle aged lady she was with: look, look *says my name, like i wouldn't hear her less than 2 feet away* 

then they both just giggle to themselves and order like nothing happened, not even apologizing or explaining why they were laughing. it's hard to explain, but it didn't feel like i was accidentally a part of an inside joke. their laughter's tone felt mean, like my existence was the butt of their joke. i'm standing there, awkward and upset but having absolutely no clue what to say without causing a scene, so i just take their order and move on.

i've had a few people ask about my name, some even crack a joke because my name is something with several meanings. it's kinda just a ""laughing with"" sort of situation. i don't mind those! i don't care at all, and it's understandable that people would be curious about an odd name. but why would you laugh in the face of that person just because of the name alone??? that's not laughing with it's being laughed at. it's insulting and dehumanizing, almost just plain playground-level bullying.

i left that job and went back to my old starbucks store as a ssv, worked there for about a year before i left again because my sm quit and our store was, well, a sh*tshow, and i wasn't making enough for the work i was doing, and this was right around the time all of the union-busting was going on and i'm very pro-union and anti-corporate.

2322,starbucks,"everyone here is blindfolded by their own ignorance. as a former barista, i see here customers who don’t understand anything about being a barista and how hard the job can be sometimes, as well as baristas who will complain about virtually anything. 

rarely on this sub you will find a middle ground of adequate baristas and customers, so i compiled a list of issues below from each side. feel free to add more in the comments:

customer’s issue:

1. my order is taking too long!!1!1!1
ma’am, starbucks can get very busy even in your buttfuckiville indiana. you’re not the only person who wants coffee in the morning. instead of fuming in the drive through, order ahead with mobile app. still though, sometimes the wait is so long, you’ll need to wait. if your cat is giving birth/kid graduating high school/you need to land a space shuttle in 10 minutes, consider leaving and coming back later. explain that you missed your order and kindly ask if baristas can do a remake. likely they will.

2. am i an asshole for ordering this drink 🥺🥺
no you’re not. baristas are paid to make drinks, you don’t have to apooogise for ordering one. just be polite and considerate. say please and thank you. pay with starbucks app if possible because it’s quickest. 

3. why is it so expensive??
corporate raised prices. we don’t charge you extra and pocket the difference i promise you. your feelings are justified, just don’t direct them at the baristas as we have no recourse with prices. contact corporate and complain to them, explain how you can’t afford to go anymore. complaining here is also appropriate if you just want to vent. this sub is for baristas and customers alike. 

baristas issues: 
1. i hate cleaning!!! we have to do so much but get paid so little it’s so ridiculous!!!!! late stage capitalism aaaaah!!
this is a response to a recent post someone made lol. i’ll say something extremely unpopular here, but here it goes. there is no job that’s not office/corporate where you don’t have to be versatile (meaning you don’t have to clean, stock, ring register, help customers at the same time). any other job - mcdonalds, dunkin donuts, walmart, chipotle all require similar job responsibilities, and all of them suck. a lot of people came to starbucks thinking they’ll be doing latte art, but of course reality is not that at all. so if you’re really unhappy with your starbucks job, i consider quitting (but not for another job like dunkin donuts) but for an office/corporate job. 

2. customers dont even know what goes in shaken espresso ahahahahaha
bitch sit down and calm your tits. i hate snobby people and this is such snobbish shit at its best. half of you don’t know what a deductible is, or what goes into your panera soup, or what is under the hood of your car. you know why? because just like customers didn’t go through starbucks training, you didn’t go through claims adjuster/panera/mechanics training. and it’s normal to not know, it’s not criminal. if you want to educate the customer, explain nicely, but don’t act like you’re better than everyone. 

3. general hate for customers 
i understand that sometimes you really want some downtime to lean against the wall and chill for a sec. it’s valid and understandable. but at the end of the day you’re there to work, that’s what you’re paid to do, and you have to face customers/make drinks/clean bathrooms. yes sometimes customers are rude and i’ll be first one in line to cuss them out, but otherwise cmon man, you signed up for the job and you’re still working there, put some effort in. if you don’t like it then consider leaving, because working at a place that you hate only makes you more tired/frustrated and customers then get bad service. no one wins at the end of the day.","calm your tits, people.

2323,starbucks,today we had a new shift supervisor open for the first time by herself today. she shouldn’t of opened on her own today cuz she’s only been with company for 3 weeks but my store is going to shit so… she doesn’t even know how to use inventory management or that an order had to placed. when i came in at 12:30 she told me this and the cut off time had already passed. tbh i don’t really know much about ordering because i don’t open and i want to know what’s gonna happen. will we just not get a truck?,order wasn’t placed: what happens?
2324,starbucks,"recently i transferred to a new starbucks in my area. this store is literal shit. ppl always trash talking each other. super bad
management and overall just bad vibes in general. a complete 360 from the location i used to work at. i’ve been reaching the end of my rope with this place and im thinking of either quitting or transferring somewhere else. anyways i saw a shift was open on the sbuxpartnerhrs app for a mid shift 10:30-2 and picked it up more than a week ago. today i show up at my shift and apparently the manager double scheduled someone else at the same time. however when i see she crossed out my name is sharpie and wrote someone else’s name im livid. she didn’t bother sending a simple text hey someone else is scheduled for that time don’t worry abt it. instead she doesn’t bother saying anything. i show up and the shift has to call her to check in the middle of peak. gas is so freaking expensive and this location isn’t really close to my house. so i texted my manager and asked if she could compensate me for gas. my friend told me that was inappropriate to ask. what do y’all think?",manager double-scheduled on my shift.

2326,starbucks,"hello all! 

i've been trying to make healthier substitutions whenever i order but i realized it's not as straight forward as it seems. i recently found out that drinks have full pumps and half pumps of syrup, and they don't specify on the app which one you're getting. i had no idea that starbucks did half pumps and i don't know how to account for that when counting calories. 

i'd order a grande shaken espresso, for example, and see that it has 4 pumps of vanilla. turns out that means half pumps or 2 actual full pumps. i was under the impression that it was 4 full pumps, which is 80 calories. meanwhile it's more like 40 calories. so when i've been substituting half the pumps for sugar-free, i've been miscalculating how many to put. also, if i add a different flavor, will that also be given as a half pump or will that one be full? do only certain flavors get half? this is so confusing for someone who isn't a barista.

can anyone provide some insight into this system?? how do i know which drinks get half and which don't? how can i account for calories?

much thanks in advance!!!",calorie counting.. half pumps??

2333,starbucks,"y'all what is the proper way to make this. i ordered this the first time about a week ago and have had it probably 4 times since then. every single time it has been made differently and i can't find a drink card on it. 

from my understanding of when i worked there in college, you'd just do straight nitro cold brew and a layer of vanilla sweet cream foam on top. the nitro would eventually separate into a nice dark body with crema on top.

but today i got one with ice. they remade it and said it was nitro but it looked like a an iced latte. light tan, no body.

last week i had one with nitro and liquid cream poured into it. 

i had another that was nitro with 2 pumps of vanilla syrup added to it and vanilla cream added.

2338,starbucks,"as the title states, i plan to connect with my dm regarding their denial of my transfer request to the store that is extremely close to where i live.

currently, the store i work at is about an hour and a half commute (bus, as i don’t own a car) and since i have to take two busses, it has caused me to become late due to the busses arriving late sometimes or having other complications.

recently, last month, my sm wrote a corrective action (1st one) regarding my tardiness, and i explained to her the situation. she seemed understanding and in full support of me transferring.

the store next to my house is a 25 minute walk or one bus. it would help me immensely.

the store manager for the store that i want to transfer to is in full support of it as well. 

however, the dm denied the request due to my recent corrective action regarding being late…

… even though that’s the entire reason and point of the transfer.

i talked to another sm about it and she said that it’s policy to wait 6 months after a corrective action but that it ultimately lies on the dms decision. 

i texted her in hopes of connecting the next opportunity that me and her get.

i plan to highlight how this is imperative for my success.

any tips? can the dm approve it despite the recent corrective action if i change their mind?",planning to connect with dm about transferring stores — need advice !
2339,starbucks,so a partner at our store tested positive and our sm told us that most of us have to wear masks although most of that group hasn’t been in contact with her for 48 hours or more since she tested positive. if we haven’t been in contact for more then 48 hours do we still have to wear a mask at work? there is no mask mandate in our state our county right now.,mask procedure after covid exposure
2340,starbucks,"hey. so, i began working on my college starbucks 4 months ago. i really like the job but i sometimes get distracted and mess up (i have severe adhd). i consider myself very hard-working and always take the initiative to help out. the issue is that when i started working i wasn't given a training package nor a starbucks shirt (which i still haven't been given one) and was trained for like 3 days. i also feel left out by my coworkers. i try to be nice and respectful to them but they are sometimes rude (like they turned off the lights while i was still washing dishes) and are pretty indifferent towards me (even when i make an effort to be nice and friendly). this has kinda affected my performance since i'm constantly overthinking this and due to being distracted i make mistakes. understandably, my coworkers get frustrated with me and explain to me the same process over and over (even the simplest things). they also stare at me while i make drinks which makes me anxious. i am aware they do this to help me but this makes me very anxious and nervous, since they tell me things i already know which is counterproductive to their time and mine. as i said, i'm very hard-working, always willing to learn new things and i currently think i have improved and feel very confident in bar (i might make some mistakes but that's it). i feel sometimes they are too harsh to me. i also feel that i have been neglected by starbucks (not being trained properly since the beggining, ignoring me, just assigning closing shifts now at l this point. i recognize i've gain a reputation but and i know my partners just want the team to work but the fact that i am constantly being monitored even when i'm doing things right and the fact that i feel i cannot make mistakes and others can is making me very anxious because as i said i tried my best to be good, or even perfect. i still have to learn how to brew coffee and some other stuff and i am willing to take my partner's help in that department.

the manager spoke to me saying that several leads have complained saying that after four months things are not sticking in my head. she also some people don't wanna work with me because they have to ""train me"" all the time. that they have invested time and money to train me and that my paychecks have just being for being trained (which is partially not true because i work a lot and thing i'm valuable in the team). she also said that she thought about transferring me but that she doesn't wanna give up on me yet. she wants to work on accomodations (which i found very nice of her part). she told me to email her about what i think would be best for me. i have been thinking about some ideas. i don't wanna victimize myself or be rude. i know i can do better and i want to be better.

sorry for the grammar mistakes i'm just ranting.",my coworkers don't like working with me and the manager just had a conversation with me

2343,starbucks,i have heard now from multiple sources that corporate is implementing a new policy that all partners must work a minimum of 16 hours each week. and that partners who can’t meet the requirement will be fired. if this is true then 1) it seems really sketchy and 2) like a third of my store will be fired. i’m a student and can only work 10 hours during the school year despite being one of the veteran partners at my store so this seems really unfair.,has anybody else heard about the new minimum hours requirement?!

2346,starbucks,"i’m sure it was horrible for everyone, but i just wanted to complain. it was just me and another girl as shift today, and both of us are barely out of our ssv training. the other experienced ssv got covid and no one else was available but the other new ssv. i also never worked mids very often as a barista and haven’t worked a mid in months, only closes. i understood what barista tasks got done during mid shifts (foh floors and bathrooms), but i did not have a grasp of what the mid shift’s shift tasks were.  i’m very experienced with closing and closing tasks that need to be done and when they need to get done by to have a good close and understood as a barista what shift tasks there were to do during closing shifts and a general idea of when they’re done, so it was very challenging as all my training shifts were closing shifts (plus the practice opening shift).  i did not get one practice shift for a mid even though i generally did not work mids often enough to know them well. 


anyway, so i got there at 12, it was packed. we usually start doing foh floors at 12/12:30ish, but we were no where near capable of sending someone to do a section of floors and being able to keep up with business, but no big deal, it’s fine if we start a little later. i was on front and food. i had a line of cafe, drive thru, and mobile food orders, the majority of which had to be warmed, so nothing that is quick to grab and hand out. it took forever for me to get food because there were so many people coming in, but we didn’t have enough staffed to have its own warming person. meanwhile, my sm had scheduled me and 4 other people for our pay increase conversations during this shift, meanwhile we have to run like 4 10s, and with a limited amount of staff, it was very difficult to plan out when we should send people on their 10s or send people to talk to the sm. we tried our best and got done with what we had. we didn’t get to starting the first section of foh floors until around 3. 


we were running out of so much. we were getting low on iced coffee and i didn’t have time to even make more. it felt like it took me 45 minutes to brew the iced coffee and make it. we ran out of sfv and i had to step off the floor to call around to other stores for more. and then a woman gets rear-ended in the drive thru and i had to fill out an incident report. 


our ice machine is broken and the repair men are basically saying it’s not and refuse to fix it for some reason. we ran out of ice, but had to figure out who we could send to buy more ice as this would cause a lot of problems due to the tuesday 50% off cold drinks. so i decide i’ll go on my 10 and get ice (the other shift made me take a 10 after i got back since that wasn’t a real break). i’m gone for like 25 minutes getting 15 bags of ice at walmart. i come back and i have to lug all these bags of ice inside from my car to inside our store.


i get back and we’re out of lemonade, peach juice, oatmeal (nbd no one ever orders oatmeal at my store anyway), lime bars, coffee base, tomato mozzarella, strawberry acai, mango dragonfruit inclusions, and half the protein boxes). my sm was able to grab us sfv from another store. we also have to pull, clean, and make 3 toddies. 


while my sm was at the other store picking up sfv, she had to have a conversation with their sm because one of the baristas from their store worked at our store last week and something happened. the other ssv was out at 3. my sm comes back upset and saying she was embarrassed by the conversation with the other sm. my sm just wanted to go home, but i had to remind her she had to teach me how to do the change order since i was never taught during my training. so my sm stayed and taught me how to do the change order. my sm leaves. 


it’s 3:45 and the closing shift comes in and i’m out at 4. i was so relieved to see them. 4 comes around and i’m so ready to leave, but then we realize that a barista who was supposed to be here at 3:45 isn’t here. we call them, they don’t answer. no call no show. (they almost walked out last tuesday and i honestly don’t blame them for not coming, half off cold drinks tuesday’s are the worst shifts to work) i offered to stay until 8 because i felt bad because that barista was supposed to close and the other closer is a green bean, and although i really wanted to leave, i need the hours. 


i’m supporting on cafe/mobile orders on bar meanwhile i have about 14 mobile order tickets stuck on the counter because no one marked out lemonade or strawberry acai, and with each person that walked in the store, i checked with each of them if they were there picking up one of those mobile orders we can’t make and discussing with them what they want to do instead, while also simultaneously trying to make drinks quickly. i had an obnoxious kid asking me to put whipped cream on his parent’s iced coffees (when i tell you he was being obnoxious, i mean it. my coworker loves kids and tolerates them pretty well, but even she said he was obnoxious). 


we try to get hot bars done, but we have a green bean doing dishes and they’re not very efficient with washing dishes so they don’t put all the hot bar pieces in the dishwasher at once. they put them in one load at a time while washing other unrelated task dishes. i get sent on my lunch. 


the rest of the shift didn’t go too bad until we ran out of whipped cream and couldn’t find the time to make more at the moment. thankfully, by the time i was out (which was an hour before close) they had caught up on all the tasks and were halfway through the restock. 


as everyone else has said, 50% of cold drinks every tuesday in july is bs. they understaff us every time and we are not capable of keeping up with the demand. i hate feeling watched by every single customer in the store because they don’t care that we are understaffed and somehow believe they could keep up with it. we are trying our best with what we are given. 


tldr: i hate 50% off cold drinks tuesdays in july",today was horrible. trenta rant.

2367,starbucks,"the past couple of weeks, i’ve had 2 separate customers yell at me. i love my job but some of these customers really test my nerves sometimes. i don’t know if its something in the air or what but people have been so rude, impatient &amp; mean lately. 

today i was seconds away from an absolute meltdown. we had a bit of a rush with both cafe customers &amp; cars in the drive thru. i was on cold bar, cranking out frappacinos &amp; refreshers. i was pulling stickers &amp; making drinks in the order they were printing. a middle-aged woman who ordered in cafe starts yelling across the counter “ma’am, ma’am, ma’am,” &amp; i’m trying to get my drinks out. i turn around “yes, ma’am?”. she very rudely goes “what are your drive thru orders your guys’ priority or something?! we’re still waiting on drinks,” and i respond “i’m making drinks in the order that the stickers are printing out,” and go back to what i was doing. 
i’m very clearly on cold bar; not espresso bar. 

in conclusion, please be patient &amp; don’t be a jerk. i’m so sick of the attitude, people being impatient when they clearly see we have other drinks in our queue &amp; expecting to have their order magically appear out of thin air. i’m tired of being yelled at when i’m trying my best or it’s something i’m not even responsible for.",[venti rant] i’ve been yelled at 2 times in the last 2 weeks by customers for things outside of my control 😍

2370,starbucks,"i don’t normally drink nitro, but i decided to give one a go this morning because i was seeking the help from the extra caffeine. 

i felt like i got 10-30% liquid, rest micro bubbles and then the chocolate cream cold foam.

i haven’t gotten a nitro since like when every location started to get availability, and maybe getting the cold foam on top didn’t help me decipher the difference between the foam from nitro cold brew vs chocolate cold foam. 

i honestly don’t remember the nitro cold brew being a fizzy bubbly drink but after a little research i found that it was. i just don’t remember it being this little of actual liquid. kinda got angry a bit when it was handed to me.

man: do you guys offer a free item on birthdays?

me: yes sir, we do! :)

man: cool, todays my birthday, here’s my id. :) 

me: i’m sorry sir, the only way to redeem the free birthday item is by providing your starbucks app so we can link it to your account. that or a linked gift card.

man: *a bit upset* aww man, fine whatever. *pays for drink &amp; i hand it to him.*
 
man: can i also get a venti cup of ice?

me: at the moment i can only offer you a grande cup of ice since we’re short on venti cups if that’s okay.

man: are you f*cking kidding me? not even on my f*cking birthday?!!

i just don’t think 12 hours a week will be doable for me with a full time teaching job, and i will definitely be leaving if that’s the case. it seems like they’re screwing over other seasonal workers like college/high school students too. doesn’t seem like the typical union busting shenanigans since they usually have been targeting full timers instead. heck, 3 ssvs and at least 5 baristas at my store have all been consistently working less than 12 hours a week for the past few months.

i could be wrong but that's what i heard. anyway i was wondering if the starbucks at universities get starbucks benefits cause my university has 3 and only one of them has outright said oh we're not technically a starbucks and they had like a slightly different menu but the others were just normal starbucks so if i transfer to one in the university will it be like an actual starbucks with starbucks benefits or do i have to transfer to one in the city if i want to keep my benefits and stuff.

2394,starbucks,"tldr; i went to treatment unexpectedly and was unable to fill out my loa or medical leave paperwork. my manager told me it was unnecessary and everything was fine, except oops, you lost your raise because you (or your abusive parents) didn’t file any paperwork. what do i do

in october, i was taken by transporters (came in at 2am, no warning) to a (primitive) wilderness therapy program. i stayed there 13 weeks, and afterwards i was sent to a year long transition program but only stayed there a month and a half. i was 16 when i was transported and i celebrated my birthday in february. i knew my mom had the power to apply for medical leave or a loa for me while i was literally miles from powerlines or roads that weren’t dirt. i begged her over letters, which had a weird delay because of the therapist giving me their letters and mine going out the same day, meaning i couldn’t reply until another week later; that made solid answers take two or more weeks to get to me. the only actions she took were calling my manager twice (he didn’t pick up) and visiting my store once just to ask for him and only telling one shift where i went. obviously i was sent in part because of my awful relationship with my parents, and at the time i really couldn’t trust them for shit. my mom kept forgetting and eventually i just gave up. after i got home, march 1st, i took time to adjust to life back at home before trying to get back with starbucks. my manager from before (who literally felt more like a father to me than my own😅) transferred to another store ~30 min away and was replaced by steve. obviously this was gonna be an obstacle but i had no idea how huge. i started applying and lobbying the shit out of steve to help me (getting the option to apply took weeks on its own, the system was messed up and there was no option to apply as a barista when i looked up my store. steve acted like this was completely out of his power and it took me roping in my old manager who had his own things going on at his own store to get that option up.) after i applied successfully, i had to do it again because steve couldn’t find it. a few more weeks of badgering him for an interview, and i got my first sip on memorial day. and my sister in law pointed out to me that i shouldve gotten an interview so i could discuss my pay and have a chance to negotiate it. weeks later, after seeing my paycheck and feeling the suspicion that not everything was back to normal, i asked steve to check my hourly pay in front of me, just in case. and my fears were right, i was back at base pay. 
brief wage history: i started at 10.50 5/11/2021, then in august there was a regional base pay raise to 12 and partners in the region hired before july something 2021 got a percentage bonus because we were doing spectacularly in sales, so i went up to 12.60$. 
i’m so overly pissed. i had asked steve how i could apply for a past medical leave or if there’s any paperwork i can do to mark myself as not fired and in treatment from october-march and he said “we’ll deal with that when you get hired”, “we’ll deal with that later”, “oh! you don’t need to do that, you’re back as everything’s normal, you were marked as rehirable so it’s not a stain on your record.” and then when i asked to see my pay and he blubbered an explanation, he said that because i didn’t do loa or medical leave paperwork i lost that raise. so i did fucjing need it!!! and nows when he tells me oh we can’t go back in time to do that, it’s beyond my power, but i’ll call partner resources and try i guess. i have to come up to him because he hasn’t gotten back to me at all, and that’s when i corner him in the back room asking him what’s the update. the way he spoke i’m so sure he actually didn’t do shit. and he treated me like i was being petty, 60 cents is so small and you’re getting the raise to 15 on august 1st anyways! even though i’ve been back  almost 2 months and that fucking makes a difference. steve keeps saying things are out of his power as an excuse.. does he not realize he’s two levels above me and if he can’t reach up there i sure as fuck can’t? and i know there’s never nothing to be done, especially in special cases like mine. i’m so fucking distraught, after missing actual months of work being in treatment, i come home and i have to work to get everything back to normal, and i’m finally told great!! after working your ass off everything is back to normal even though it fucking wasn’t. i just know my old manager would’ve had my raise reinstated and i would’ve been compensated for the time i didn’t have it by now. please help me.",lost my raise due to an unexpected medical leave.. and i had no clue. please help

2421,starbucks,"so, i am a recently promoted ssv. i got done with my training two weeks ago and they were looking to hire another ssv because a bunch just left our store. specifically, they are looking for a barista that can work mids and closes, while occasionally a few opens. we have a new sm that started around the time i interviewed for the promotion. she interviewed two baristas i work with. 

barista #1: is a hard worker, knows the ins and outs of starbucks, does a lot of coaching, and is a barista trainer. can work opens, mids, and closes and is well-versed in all 3. always works with a sense of urgency and takes a lot of initiative. has had ssv experience before at another coffee shop. 

barista #2: has only worked opens and mids, has never closed before. has a huge attitude and rolls their eyes whenever anyone (regardless of if they’re a barista or an ssv) asks them to do their job and occasionally laughs and says no. we’ve had a problem with their behavior after they sexually harassed one of their trainees to the point where the trainee (who worked with us for like 5 months) just quit because they can’t stand working with barista #2 anymore. (i think our old sm knew about this, but our new sm definitely doesn’t)

guess who our sm promoted?

barista #2

a lot of us believe this is straight up favoritism because our sm works with barista #2 a lot and of course when the sm is there, barista #2 actually does their job and acts like they are a great employee. our sm rarely works with barista #1. 

another ssv and i asked our manager if we could have a conversation with her about our concerns about barista #2’s promotion, but now i’m starting to worry this will reflect badly on my part. i just do not think barista #2 is capable or deserving of the promotion and a lot of the closing baristas have issues about it too. 

my other ssv that i’m going to be having the conversation with our sm with said that they’ve done this in the past where they brought up concerns about another ssv, but to be fair, he was making customers and baristas uncomfortable and would literally talk to our regulars about having an std, which starbucks is not the time nor place to talk about that stuff , especially with a customer. 

was this a bad idea? our sm has agreed to talk to us. i don’t want my sm thinking i have it out for barista #2 or am trying to get them to change their mind, they just genuinely don’t realize that this is what barista #2 is like when they’re not around.",ssv in need of advice
2422,starbucks,"question to my fellow canadian partners. i am not yet ready to tell my manager, but i may be moving a couple cities over (about 2 hours away) as soon as november.

i am wondering if it is worth bothering to transfer to another city or not. is that something partners can do easily enough in the first place?

two factors that make this even more difficult:

i am just about to come back to starbucks after a long loa (parental leave).

and my partner is adamant about taking a 2 week trip to another country so our baby can meet their relatives. if we move, the trip will happen right after we move out/before we move to new home. if we don't move, thr trip will probably still happen (i am also anxious about asking for that time off so soon after my loa, especially when i used all my vacation time before my maternity leave.)

at this rate i'm wondering if i should just quit. but i like starbucks and i'd hate to have no job to come home to.

so, partners, is transfering even a realistic option in the first place? how about in this wild situation?",should i transfer if i'm moving cities?
2423,starbucks,"it’s been three years for me. i gave everything and more to my store. i was overworked and under appreciated. now it’s time to move on to bigger and better things, including working for a company that will actually appreciate what i bring to the leave. when you leave starbucks, leave happy and with zero regrets.",273 clocking out

stage four: depression. it’s leaving. the almond croissant is really leaving. you will never again taste that smooth almondy filling.

we have problem customers, like every other store. a gentleman comes in 5 times a week for a hot cinnamon dolce. he mobile orders maybe 15-20 minutes before he arrives, so when he gets here, all of the foam and whip are gone/ melted. he complains about this, every single day he's here.

one of our partners who is an absolute sweetheart and amazing with customer connection tried to explain that if he doesn't want all that room, that ordering no foam and no whip will guarantee a perfect drink every time. his response was ""i shouldn't have to do your job for you!"" and he stormed out.

yesterday, i was making drinks and didn't realize who's drink i pulled, so i made it like normal, whip, foam, the works. now, i'm not the best bar partner, but i loved bar, and i've never received a complaint about too much foam on my drinks before. i try and be careful to give people the amount they ordered if that makes sense. 

but anyways, i'm continuing my bar life all fine when this customer comes in. he grabs his drink, opens the top, and immediately looks angry. i go to ask what the problem is, but he turns and heads straight to our manager. 

not a problem, the manager is probably just explain what all of us have been explaining, right?

wrong.

he comes over and asks me to put only streamed milk in to top off the cup. i mean, we told him to order without whip, but if you say so boss! the amount of room left was maybe a little more than an inch. not crazy if you understand hot drinks (at least i think so?). i fill his grande and go back to my thing. 

after he leaves my manager come over to talk to me. he told me the amount of room in the cup was ""excessive"" and that, from now on, i have to do no foam for every single hot drink. only me. no one else on the floor was told this. i spent the next part of my shift attempting this idea and, not only was it slowing things down like crazy, my bar was constantly covered in milk from me scooping out foam.

by the end of the day, i wanted to cry. i had multiple people get angry about times and the fact that i can't do my favorite position anymore makes me... just want to quit.

2467,starbucks,"i'm writing here because my voice is small.

my name is l, my coworker, we'll call him m, reported me for sexual harassment about two weeks ago and insisted that my sm doesn't speak to me about it or even mention it. m mentioned two things, us talking about his cuts and his private sex life. 

this conversation was months ago and while i may have mentioned his cuts that day i was very careful to be as respectable as possible. the conversation lasted at most three minutes and the last that i remember is him saying he's quit since last january (which is awesome!) now regarding the private sex life, i don't need nor want to know what you do or what sex your partner is but, i understand sensitivity can be a very delicate topic.

i'm willing to say that the conversation might have moved to a sexual place (at most asking if he had a partner) but again i have no desire into knowing your ins and outs. now, had i known m felt this way i would have immediately apologized contritely but m doesn't want me to know. that's fine, but do not ever f%&amp;@king send anyone after me to fix your ""problem"" again.

he made this report around the beginning of july after coming back from a month's leave. again i was not informed about this harassment until july 10th, the day after one of m's friends stalked me from my store for 15 minutes. i honestly don't even want to write about it cause so much happened.

he was waiting for me at the door while interrogating my sm asking her why i haven't been fired yet. that's all i heard from the conversation and sm lets me out when he leaves. mind you i'm as clueless as a capybara at this moment but, it would have been great to be told what was going on, especially since it regards me.

after 15 minutes i notice what was going on so i just confronted him. immediately he started in an aggressive tone (l, hey you know you shouldn't say those things, l you're making all of your coworkers uncomfortable, l you're a fucking creep, l you shouldn't be working there). my favorite one was, (you don't know what you did?!?!) no, i'm sorry could you please be more descriptive! 

knowing what sex he was talking about would have really helped though, it wouldn't have stopped his rage. after i was constantly denying his vague allegations and gaslighting he finally just smacked my phone out of my hand and kicked the drink i had in a bag all over myself. i was enraged but i was more confused than anything cause i know i'm not either of those disgusting things.

i filed a police report, returning back to work the next day involuntarily agitated. this is where my sm finally tells me what's going on. i spoke to her respectfully expressing that this type of behavior outside is way beyond the line and that you can't gatekeep information at its most pivotal moment especially if it is concerning me. m is still working there reprimand-free due to some legal reasons i'm assuming. but if this happened in any other non-corporate his ass would have been thrown.

honestly, i'm writing this cause i have no fight in me anymore and i'm planning on quitting in the coming time anyways. this violation is just another box to add to the already over-checked list of issues with this company (sorry howard).

so i leave you with my story so that we may discuss it professionally in the comments.

and to any charitable individuals that i would consider a friend please be careful out there. no matter anywhere in life there will be incredibly sensitive situations in which you must set your pride aside on. m couldn't give me the respect i deserved but all it did was make me stronger. i have a newfound confidence in life because i didn't feel like a victim. m clearly felt like one and i hope it stays in its head like a neverending bad dream. i've learned to let go however, i feel like he should be fired.",coworker sends its friend after me. what's your crazy work drama?

he made this report around the beginning of july after coming back from a month's leave. again i was not informed about this harassment until july 10th, the day after one of m's friends stalked me from my store for 15 minutes. i honestly don't even want to write about it cause so much happened. he was waiting for me at the door while interrogating my sm asking her why i haven't been fired yet. that's all i heard from the conversation and sm lets me out when he leaves. mind you i'm as clueless as a capybara at this moment but, it would have been great to be told what was going on, especially since it's regarding me. 

after 15 minutes i notice what was going on so i just confronted him. immediately he started in an aggressive tone (l, hey you know you shouldn't say those things, l you're making all of your coworkers uncomfortable, l you're a fucking creep, l you shouldn't be working there). my favorite one was, (you don't know what you did?!?!) no, i'm sorry could you please be more descriptive! knowing what sex he was talking about would have really helped though, it wouldn't have stopped his rage. after i was constantly denying his vague allegations and gaslighting he finally just smacked my phone out of my hand and kicked the drink i had in a bag all over myself. i was enraged but i was more confused than anything cause i know i'm not either of those disgusting things.

i file a police report and i return back to work the next day involuntarily agitated. i spoke to my sm respectfully expressing that this type of behavior is way beyond the line and that you can't gatekeep information at its most pivotal moment especially if it is concerning me. m is still working there reprimand-free due to some legal reasons i'm assuming. but if this happened in any other non-corporate his ass would have been thrown. 

honestly, i'm writing this cause i have no fight in me any more and i'm planning on quitting in the coming time anyways. this violation is just another box to add to the already over-checked list of issues with this company (sorry howard). 

so i leave you with my story so that we may discuss it professionally in the comments.

and to any charitable individuals that i would consider a friend please be careful out there. no matter anywhere in life there will be incredibly sensitive situations in which you must set your pride aside on. m couldn't give me the respect i deserved but all it did was make me stronger. i have a newfound confidence in life because i didn't feel like a victim. m clearly felt like one and i hope it stays in its head like a neverending bad dream. i've learned to let go however, i feel like he should be fired.",my story about a complicated and sensitive workplace problem.

small preface: in dt i ask my customers random ""favorites"" questions as a means of connecting, such as ""what's your favorite color/movie/boardgame?""

so this customer dings the bell, and i greet and ask away.
customer replied, ""why are you asking those ridiculous questions?"" to which i stated ""i'm just trying to get to know my customers better!""

their response: ""that ain't the way to do it. can i just order my damn coffee now?""

2477,starbucks,"hey all ssv’s out there! do you ever feel like that ever since you’ve been promoted, some people have painted a target on your back?
a lot of us, including me, at my store are either in college or work part time. only a few have made this their career (which is super cool!). but it’s those who aren’t planning to make this their career who do the most. 
i got promoted in january and i really have been loving it, i love most people here, and i have so much fun on all my shifts when i am key-holder! i’ve been complimented lots on my work style and i genuinely feel liked by at least 95% of the staff due to all the positive feedback. 

the 5%, have made it really hard for me the past while, especially lately and find so many opportunities to bring me down. i find my boss is having to talk to me lots about their complaints and it’s always the people (including one ssv) who have bullied many others that many people have problems with. i know this because i was once that barista who was bullied by this same person and have been told stories by others. 

i made amends with them by approaching them one on one and fixing it months ago. 
but today, they caused an issue where the dm has to get involved now and i spent my whole day crying. i wish i didn’t care so much but it’s been bringing everyone down including me. i’m just very drained from it all. and my boss knows that i am not the issue and she told me to take some time and put my mental health first. it’s been ever since my promotion where things have gotten so bad with a couple of people ganging up on me and dragging me into issues where i try to just walk away from. 
i’m just trying to make my money and go home but this place is consuming me because i want to do a good job and get along with everyone! after today i can feel myself getting so cold and i basically need advice lol. 
i’ve been told that people really like me and i noticed this other ssv hasn’t gotten the same feedback that i have over the months of my promotion and it almost feels like a jealousy thing? even when i get along with people they dislike, they would bring it to my attention that it’s an issue and that it bothers them. i never know how to react to that because i am so flabbergasted that that’s a real, genuine reaction to something that doesn’t concern them. 

 (pls note that not everyone likes me but i do feel like a lot of people do because i genuinely care about them and am positive/apologize when i mess up)

i never get mad at people. i never lash out. i coach when needed and do my job as efficiently as possible. i can take constructive criticism. i care so so so much and maybe that’s the issue. 

i just never have met someone who seeks out opportunities to hurt others and then play victim when it benefits them. it feels personal. sometimes i wish i was a barista again instead. maybe then i wouldn’t be brought down so much? i wonder if i am the issue in the workplace and i don’t see it? i really don’t know what i did to be so disliked by this particular ssv.

we have issues at our store dealing with cash management, while a lot has gotten better we are still constantly having variances in our deposit details (both under and over… and wellllll beyond the $5 grace)

we use the “cashier report” to par/pull till after each assigned partner that handled cash.

at the bottom of the cashier report there is a “cash total” and “total due” that should be stating the total amount of cash that should be pulled (the finalized deposit amount) according to the system.

if you look in deposit details under reports in cash management, there is “system count” at the very top of each finalized deposit.

recently, my mother started to slowly take my things, specifically my cups . i have cups all the way back to 2018 that i can’t just go to another starbucks and pick up .. i noticed my cups in her room, full and filthy with god knows what, so i confronted her and asked her to please not take them or at the very least wash them and don’t let them mold . i’ve even asked her to please let me know if she’s going to use them, and to respect them because i spent a lot of money on them .. 
i figured she maybe wasn’t purposely being malicious, and even bought cups and other dishes for the house, so our cabinets are full with them .. but she didn’t stop, now she’s taking the straws out of my cups, and they are no where to be found, she denies taking them and calls me crazy and insane and tells me “they are just cups” and to just “get more” ?? it feels very malicious and petty to take the straws from out of the cups and have them disappear . she’s upset with me because i assumed it was her, but my grandfather can’t use straws, and my boyfriend chronically drinks soda from cans .

• i read that you can only get one surgery per year. if that’s accurate, do the surgeries have to be exactly a year apart, or could you, for example, get one surgery in december 2022 and another in january 2023?  i hope that makes sense.

she refused to believe that i put the ones i made in the back, and told me today’s date was the 16th — so i tried to explain oh, i must have written the wrong date on the ones i just made but they did go in the back, and she wouldn’t even accept that, it couldn’t be that i did the right thing. the shift supervisor told her to back off and then checked and corrected the dates on the pitchers marked for monday but he clearly blamed me and saw me as being like, stubborn for insisting i was right when i was just trying to understand what error was made where 

i just… am i getting fired over this? this partner once reported me for “breathing too loud” and i got a connect over that where i was encouraged to quit before i got written up, this is more substantial because we got into it. i need this job. i need to go to asu online and i need to have my transition covered and i just got enough hours to qualify. i’m terrified i can’t stop crying i didn’t do anything wrong",how screwed am i?

""oh- uhm, i don't believe so, im sorry! i can remake it if you'd like!"" she glares at me and takes a sip of her drink, and i shit you not, this lady gags and shakes her head saying ""no no. nope this is not 180 degrees. there's a setting on the thing *points to mastrena* where you can override. if you can't do it, go find someone else to do it for you."" she then hands me the drink and i tell her we can't take it back because she's already drank out of it. and then she asks if i want the sticker, and i was like okay sure whatever. then she starts reprimanding me for not knowing how to override the temp monitor and im pissed cause i've got 12+ unpulled tickets and here i am being dehumanized by a 60 year old woman. so, i grabbed my shift, he made her drink, gave it to her, she takes a sip, and goes ""oh! this is perfect thank you so much!""

2616,starbucks,"three months ago i started full-time employment as an operations coordinator in the tech sector and left starbucks a few weeks ago. i had my first performance review today. it was overly positive - because of traits i picked up at starbucks. 

resourcefulness - we’ve all macguyvered a cold brew contraption, we research online barista communities for help, and starbucks provides lots of information in different places we have to hunt for. 

consistency - hello, standards! being able to be consistent with your work is a huge selling point. 

multitasking - if you can leave shots to pull and put food in the oven while taking a drive thru order, you can write an email while sitting in on a meeting. 

openness to any task - nothing is too big or too small to take on. 50 drinks in a mobile order, to scrubbing toilets, to training the next generation of beans. you’re not scared. 

productivity - when the drive thru dragon of 45 cars in half an hour is terrorizing your dreams, friday deliverables are a breeze.

2637,starbucks,"hello! 

so here's my situation, i transferred from a starbucks i had been working at since july to another starbucks in december, with that i was given more hours and was properly trained at the new store. at first i loved the manager and loved all my coworkers and even loved the area and regulars. 

since then it's changed, the manager who i used to love has started scheduling me less starting back in april due to 3 sick callouts while also has scheduled me to retrain on bar next week even though honestly i personally think i'm pretty okay at. my only issue is when i wasn't medicated which i started medication like two weeks ago, i would get very stressed during peak, but i could kind of manage. i do not think that is worth 8 hours of retraining either. my manager has scheduled me for at most 10-15 hours a week even though my availability is all day every day. 

coming up is when i will not be able to really work weekdays and i told him that on the weekends i would love to be able to work at least 6 hour shifts a day. he told me that because of that bar retraining he's hesitant to schedule me for more hours and told me a shift told him i said a few times i was tired after a longer shift and basically said that unless i can really work hard for those hours he will not schedule me for longer shifts. 

recently, i worked at my old store and they are currently in the process of getting a new manager and when i worked an 8 hour shift there i helped train a new partner on bar, was very productive, overall, i just had a really good time. the ssv there even told me she saw potential in me to be a trainer and possibly a ssv when i turn 18. the entire shift had me thinking about how i'm so tired of how my manager doesn't schedule me even though i've asked a few times, and i get so incredibly stressed out at this location.

i want to transfer, i miss my old coworkers as well, but, some things are holding me back such as how acessible it is to get to my current store, my current store has the newer machines (ovens, manstrettas, etc.) while my old store doesn't. those are really the only things holding me back and of course my coworkers. i just feel like i shouldn't have to stay at a store i'm not happy and while transportation is easier to manage than my old store, i don't want to feel like i have to prove myself in a way to even get hours. please, help me make this decision please.",considering transferring (again lol)

2643,starbucks,"so i recently moved go washington. i’ve been here since the 1st and i now work at a license store as a shift. before i moved here  i was an assistant for a license store so i know the starbucks standard very well and i also know that the store will operate different since it’s not in a grocery store like my previous store. anyways, since i started working here i’ve been micromanaged on everything. when they can’t talk because they don’t do a lot of things right according to starbucks standard. we use the book/ipad for temps only. clean plays aren’t used and nothing is being communicated through the book. it’s quite literally empty besides temps. not only that they way drinks are made is just stressful to watch. example : shaken espresso‘s are made by syrup in a cup then espresso directly in the shaker then ice and shake. …??? like no.  day 2 of me being there the privilege to eat anything on shift whether it be from home or from the store has been taken away. unless you take a 30 unpaid break. which would bring employees to less than 6 hour shifts. not only that but my roommates parter and i carpool sometimes since we don’t have cars today i brought my partner into work since i couldn’t bring him home first dude to timing and gas. i told them they could sit in the lobby till i was done. this is something i’ve always done. at my last store and previous coffee shops i’ve worked at. they bought a drink and a food item so there was no loitering. they were reading minding their own business across the store not talking to me. and the manager told me he’s not allowed to be in the store and made them leave. i’m sorry but that is ridiculous. i have never heard that. who are they to kick a paying customer who isn’t distracting out ? the other partners have been rude and micromanaging me on things they do even do to starbucks standard. the main concern is making sure there is a dot on flat whites. not cleanliness. i deep cleaned the entire bar and was asked why. i feel like i’m being dramatic but as someone who use to help run a store this has been an agonizing week to watch. i’m really bad at quitting jobs due to anxiety. a part of me just wants to never go back and not say anything but the other part of me knows it’s wrong and i’m not sure if i should wait it out and see if it gets better or just leave.",is it wrong to want to ghost my starbucks ?

i have been on a career progression path toward an assistant store manager, and was about to move stores as a part of this progression. i gave my store manager notice yesterday, and today the district manager came in unannounced to attempt to convince me to stay. she admitted they couldn’t match what i would probably make at the casino at my currant position, but promised to fast track me to management as soon as i got to the store i was originally going to move to.

2654,starbucks,"i've been working in the 'bux for a while and it's great. new coworkers come and leave, the old ones are nice as always and they're here for a reason.

a majority of my coworkers are nice, but a few are getting on my nerves with the way they are acting. i really do appreciate the ones who are polite and don't cause problems.

in one case, my usual shift lead favors one employee and allows them to not work for several hours. the lead also sit in the back playing games on their phone for hours. when i relax even after cleaning everything, i get scolded. lead ignores me/gives silent treatment to be petty. in fact, they even left the store once and left us baristas ""as a joke"". whines about wanting to quit. tells me about their life and how miserable they feel. lowers the morale of our coworkers in general, but a good worker.

a few girl coworkers seem to dislike me. they always make off-hand comments with a sarcastic tone. whenever they see me, they start furiously typing on their phone. they give me the silent treatment, but they seem afraid of me and shy away. they will always mention how ""i don't work enough or make enough money"" even though i have another job. questions about me becoming a shift lead (which i don't want at all) because they couldn't become one. 

i also reported someone for sexual harassment and somehow everyone in the store found out. it made me extremely uncomfortable that they started joking about it to me. it feels slightly traumatizing. it also feels unfair that another coworker (one of the girls mentioned) reported several cases of harassment, but no one made fun of it. it felt disrespectful.

at first i didn't mind, but as things build up it's starting to get to my head. i really like my sbux location, so i don't want to leave. (although i do have another job, and i'm looking for a better internship!)

i understand that as apart of the lower class i am going to have to pay my dues. i also know that this position will not last forever, but i need money and this is the fastest way for me to get it. my question is now that i am about to re-enter this environment, how do i keep my emotions separate from the chaos? how do i not get sucked in by the negativity? how can i create a barrier around myself so that i am able to go to work, do my job and go home without still feeling connected to all the bullshit?

2685,starbucks,"almost every time i go to starbucks i see a barista hand out the drink with a straw or use the phrase ""would you like any straws"". as a barista, i see people ask for 7 water cups in one order. i see hundreds of milk gallons thrown away in the trash, not recycled. i see people come on the daily ordering 5 fraps. it's frustrating. im sorry but store managers need to limit water cups to one/two ice waters per order. store managers need to recycle milk jugs. baristas need to stop offering straws (exceptions: unless asked for or fraps). regulars need to stop coming every single day. baristas training the trainees need to reuse the cups instead of throwing it out and making new ones in a separate cups. customers need to start bringing their own reusable straws/cups. starbucks needs to stop producing stoppers.. yes, cups are recyclable but no one actually recycles them. yes, straws are decomposable but so much carbon emissions go into producing/delivering the straws. partners, at your next store meeting come up with solutions as a team to reduce so much waste! don't just wait till corporate tells you to! customers please do your part. at this point we all know the consequences of climate change but even a small change goes a long way! :)",customers and partners do your part please

2690,starbucks,"today 30 minutes before my shift was over i had a customer as for an earl grey tea with steamed milk. so i ring it in as a tea latte, earl grey, 2% milk.

they get to the window and are surprised by the price because they say that the drink is normally 3 dollars what i charged them was 5.50.

i immediately know what’s wrong. someone has been ringing a brewed tea and writing a note that says ‘with steamed milk’ so they don’t get charged for it. i explain to the customer that previous baristas have been ringing their drink in wrong and we’re supposed to charge them for tea lattes. i even asked the store manager who was on shift at the time and he said i was in the right.

i hand the drink to them and they ask for their receipt and i nod giving it to them to to which he snatches it out of my hand.

2697,starbucks,"espressos over ice (and hot, for that matter) only get 1/2” milk (or 3/4” for extra) because any more than that gets an up-charge and is considered a latte. i get asked the question from the title quite often, and the answer is that milk to the top on an iced espresso is just an iced latte and you’re going to be charged as such. it is what it is, i know people don’t want to pay the extra charge but they have to if that’s what they’re wanting to get. you can blame corporate for that, not me. thank you for coming to my ted talk !",“why is my iced espresso never filled to the top with milk when i ask for extra?”
2698,starbucks,"i'm sure most of us have figured it out by now but... by having us take names in dt corporate has effectively forced us baristas into using names that corporate has stated we are under no obligation to say.

now don't get me wrong. the process is 100%viable and you can understand the thought process... on paper. but not as much in real life.

but because corporate doesn't think that our customers would *ever* go black lives matter, ban guns, or ""my body my choice"" as a name (despite the aforementioned policy being why we dont need to say names) they are now forcing managers who give 2 shites about their partners and do decent things to now go ""which policy do i break today? which is going to get me in the least amount of trouble?""",names in dt is a failure by fridge logic and forced good managers into a catch 22

2751,starbucks,i have been struggling with my role i'm only given one day of work plus i have another job.  i was pretty good on register the few times i worked it but since i hardly have days i ended up forgetting. i practice my drinks at home every night but i need advice on trying to memorize the register my boss gave me a warning saying if i don't shape up i will be out of there . please help i enjoy working there,struggling new barista

2753,starbucks,"i know it seems like a silly question. i work in a hospital coffee shop and we just switched to starbucks products with the ""we proudly serve"" program about 3 weeks ago. i got 2.5 hours of training, along with a girl who had just started that day, and she quit a couple days later. none of the rest of my 6 coworkers who take turns working with me, including my manager and supervisor, got any training.

today, i had the first instance of a customer trying to order a strawberry lemonade. so far, i've only used the lemonade in refreshers and iced tea lemonades. i felt stupid because i had to tell her that i don't know how to make it, we don't have a recipe for it. i also had no idea how to charge for it, because our registers seem to be nothing like a typical starbucks register from what i hear. we don't have a button for lemonade, only for refreshers and iced tea lemonades.

i tried to offer her a strawberry acai refresher with lemonade, and told her what the price would be, and she said that she had gotten a strawberry lemonade from us before and it was a different price. i'm not sure who she ordered it from who would have improvised the drink, and i know that it wouldn't have tasted the same if i had also tried to improvise it.

ultimately, the customer got frustrated enough that she didn't order anything and left. i felt bad, but my options were to either make it up, or make the refresher correctly.

do you mix the lemonade with water? is it shaken or made directly in a cup? how do i know how much strawberry puree to use? we only have grande and venti for cold drinks. do you have a specific button for lemonade?

thank you so much in advance!",how do you make a strawberry lemonade?

personally, i just don't think it would be fair to do that. i understand that there's things we can work on to help our situation (improving routines and making best moments for customers), but there's also a lot thats simply out of our control (outtages/inventory issues, short staffing, the economy right now oof, etcetera...).

“oh actually, i ordered something else”

“ this doesn’t taste right can i get it remade”

we would say to them that they can keep the incorrect drink and we’ll make the other drink, no extra cost yadda yadda

when i was taking orders one day, i had a customer come thru again, asking for his drink to be remade

immediately my colleague said to me

“this guys complained about his drink a couple times over the last week, i think he just wants a freebie”

so with this in mind i asked the customer what was wrong with his drinks

“uhhhh…” he stuttered 

“what’s actually wrong with your drink sir?”

“uhhhhhh….”

“sir what’s the problem with your drink so i don’t make the same mistake again?”

“uhh can i just get it remade?”

“no problem sir, if you just hand us the incorrectly made drink at the window and we’ll swap them out for you. thank you”

(little tickets that get target employees free drinks or pastries) i’m all for rewarding hard work (may i add we don’t get rewarded for anything not even a good job) but it’s gotten to the point where people get them because they are hungry or last saturday the front end team lead gave everyone working there one for just being there. this leads to everyone coming up during our busiest day getting large fraps and making it so we basically have longer lines and less time to restock. on top of that they come up and ask us to make them waters constantly during the day. i get people get thirsty but there are water jugs all over target and they don’t wait in line they come up to the bar and either ask or just stand there and expect us to stop what we are doing and automatically know they want a water made for them. it’s gotten to a point where they are asking for lemonade put in it or a free drink or free pastries. it makes me angry and when we are like “you were just up here” or “give me a minute i have to stock cause i’m by myself and you came right when the last customer of a rush left” they get attitude and say we are rude or mean. i don’t wanna seem mean but it makes my job harder by having to restock more frequently and stop in between customers to make these waters. i just want to find a way to make it so they don’t need to come up 8 times a shift and maybe think of us as coworkers instead of personal waiters.",what to do in this situation

2814,starbucks,"to begin with, i say none of this to instill fear but to bring awareness &amp; encourage you all to do your own further research &amp; come to your own conclusions.

i just today heard of the recalled chicken sandwich starbucks put on the menu but i believe there to be potentially pertinent information that is being overlooked or deliberately pushed aside. to my knowledge, starbucks has simply explained the recall as a “quality control” issue; this is rather ambiguous considering they were willing to provide clarity on the fact that it didn’t involve salmonella or listeria but they had no other info to provide. 

for a while now, for those that don’t know, a subtype-a influenza called h5n1 (colloquially called “bird flu”) has been spreading across the country &amp; other parts of the globe. [here is a link from a month ago that talks about h5n1](https://publichealthinsider.com/2022/05/25/alert-bird-flu-can-harm-backyard-poultry-and-wild-birds/amp/) in king county, washington where starbucks is headquartered. 

sine h5n1 first entered the u.s. there have been only either one or two human cases but the number of other animals getting it is honestly staggering; foxes, bobcats, a few other kinds of animals in the wild have either been found sick with h5n1 or dead from it. in the commercial realm of life, large-scale poultry companies that have any chickens that test positive for h5n1 [end up killing all the chickens like they did in colorado a few months ago.](https://www.peta.org/blog/22-million-birds-slaughtered-en-masse-amid-nationwide-bird-flu-outbreak/)

mind you, there are, to date, [37 states](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/data-map-commercial.html) dealing with an h5n1 outbreak right now; more than half of our nation is affected by this &amp; i point to this as potential causation for the recall - and a few others we will come to see in due time if this progress at the rate it has so far. i have no clue yet in my 45 minutes of googling where the hell they currently get their poultry ingredients from, so i reiterate: potentially, not positively fact. 

i’m going to be keeping an eye on this story, if it ever extrapolates. if anyone has any insight that makes this entire post moot, please do comment; i honestly am only providing this perspective as h5n1 isn’t as much of a talking point outside of local news stories that cover outbreaks &amp; the occasional article. 

thanks for indulging if you read this far.",the chicken sandwich quality control news had me thinking.

the complaints go on and on. it’s so hard for people to be happy with the drink because everyone has different expectations of what it is. 

obviously, i know there is a standard/recipe card baristas have read during training to make the drink so there is an expectation of what the drink should be but the customers don’t have access to the cards so it can't be helped.",i wish we could get rid of all iced shaken espressos.

i was always supportive of paying more for coffee when i knew the baristas were treated with dignity.  now, the added expense i'm seeing is going to corporate exec bonuses while people struggle to eat and have housing.  i'm not paying this company more money so that they can spend it on union busting.  i'm boycotting starbucks  and i hope one day it can get back to the roots of what it once was.",i've bought starbucks every day for the past 14 years. i'm done due to anti-union busting.

but i found out today that one of my coworkers makes 17.50. we do the same job, the only difference is that he has worked for starbucks for about 4 years. i know the raises are coming in august but i'll only be getting around 50 cents more probably, and i'm kinda peeved that someone at the same level as me makes a whole dollar more, and will be making the gap even bigger with the august raise. do you think i have grounds to try and negotiate my pay to at least match what he makes now???

i love my job. i love my coworkers. but there's just a few people that i work with that make me upset. i was warned of this by one of my shifts when i started working lol.

namely my sm. she treats me like i'm 5 years old just because i'm one of the youngest people who works there (18). i also feel as if it's because i'm autistic. she has to reiterate everything to me several times before she thinks it's even gone into my head. it feels like she thinks i don't understand english. i also have another coworker who tries to make conversation with me but then if i talk for too long she wants me to just shut the fuck up. it's only ever the partners who are older than like 35. i also feel like it's because i'm trans. my sm has misgendered the shift that told me to watch out a few times to my face when talking about him. she's even misgendered another one of our partners who's nonbinary calling them ""she"".

she got onto me for putting ""too much ice"" in her paradise drink when all i was doing was filling it up to the trenta line.. we don't have trenta ice scoops so i have to do a venti scoop and a smaller scoop. she made me dump out the drink after yelling at me across the bar and remake it. she even put the ice in herself. then told me to make sure i shook it exactly 10 times. it makes me mad because she can't even ring orders up right on the pos. she had 3 months of training on dt before becoming an sm. we don't even have a dt.

what did it for me today was when i was trying to help out one of the older partners (mentioned above ab talking too much) because this girl's birthday reward wasn't showing up and it was because you have to have the app for a certain amount of time so that you can get it. and i tried to go over and help but she snapped at me to go back to cold bar and told me she had it when she didn't.. and then my sm had to help her and they were dealing with it for like 5 minutes. i almost cried. i teared up lmao. i was so done. 

and then i got barated for wanting to get a drink on my shift but apparently starbucks standard is one before your shift, one of your break, and one after your shift. i was never taught that. she only ever yells at me to stay planted. or whenever i'm moving positions. literally got onto me for cleaning cold bar because there was another person changing out the sani-buckets next to me. 

i literally went into work 35 hours last week and cover a shit ton of people's shifts because nobody wants to ever fucking work. i bust my ass because i can never get fucking scheduled and still i'm the only one that ever gets fucking yelled at. i'm tired of it. i feel like i'm not valued as a partner. my sm and a few others keep trying to get me to transfer to another store i work at periodically because i never get scheduled at mine. i'm tired of it because they think i'm a smart ass when really i'm just trying to help out.",im tired of coworkers treating me like an incompetent child

however, me, the bozo on drive through, somehow miraculously mishears ""double"" as ""12"". i have a little difficulty hearing on the intercom sometimes evidently. perplexed, as anyone would be, i make sure to confirm with them - ""12 shots? did you say 12 shots?"" and they said yes. so i assume they also misheard me.

obviously im concerned for their wellbeing but i ring it through anyway, ive learnt by now to never question a customer, after all we've had someone come through and genuinely order a vanilla water with light milk before. anyway, my fellow baristas are also concerned, but make the drinks anyway since the customers said yes to my confirmation.

they get to the window, their order is like 30 dollars or some wild shit for 2 drinks. they still pay anyway and do not ask questions. as my colleague hands off the drinks, she confirms one last time, ""you wanted 12 shots right?"" and theyre just. confused. like ""no we didn't want 12 shots?"" but then, they say ""it's fine"" and take the drinks anyway. they did not ask for a remake? they literally drove off with the 12-shot caramel macchiatos. this is the most bewildering part of the story to me.

it's in a college town that has a ton of coffee shops and it's probably among the least popular, not because it's bad but because it's a chain and people prefer the locally owned ones. 

it's open from 6 am to 7:30 pm on weekdays and 7 am to 7 pm on weekends. i will probably be working as an opener or from around 5:30-6 am to around 12 pm most of the time unless my schedule changes.

most of what i've seen in guides for new hires talk a lot about dt, so i'm really nervous about not knowing what to expect. does anyone work at a similar store and have advice for a new person?

thanks!!!",nervous about what to expect

2993,starbucks,"“but the other starbucks makes it for me this way all the time”

the other starbucks probably hasn’t been deep cleaned in months and might not be sanitary. they might not be dating their backup ingredients or food correctly either, they may not be giving their baristas/shifts proper or formal training especially on things that matter like sanitation/handling chemicals/etc. 

i thought of this anecdote bc there’s this other store in my district thats kind of infamous for not making drinks to standard and just giving customers whatever they want even if it is completely against the quality standards. and a lot of people in my city love that store bc the partners will just give them whatever they want even if it’s not remotely allowed; that store also has a mold problem and a fly problem, hasn’t had clean play scheduled in months, don’t make backups consistently, etc. 

to their credit they haven’t had consistent management in a long time which is the reason for a lot of this, so i don’t blame any of the baristas for this stuff bc i know a lot of it is out of their control and they haven’t been trained properly. but there are some stores i’ll never visit on my days off because i know too much and that store is one of them.","if you get told that the way “the other starbucks” makes your drink isn’t to standard, don’t get mad at the person who told you that, think about all the other things that store is probably doing wrong."

we as customers have more power to make change than baristas do. we can ask managers to stop asking for names in the drive thru, and we can call starbucks corporate to complain. if enough of us ask for change, they'll stop.

when we're asked this, it's important to remember that the baristas hate it as much as we do, and that baristas and other customers don't want want us to hold up the line. be kind to your baristas, and when you get asked for your name in drive thru, you can follow this script:

**barista: ""can i get a name for your order?""**

**customer: ""i'd like to decline to give my name. can you let your manager know that i hate being asked for my name in the drive thru?""**

you can also call starbucks customer service at 800-starbuc (800-782-7282) from 5am – 8pm pt, 7 days a week. when calling, you can use this script:

""hi, i'd like to make a complaint about a new process in the starbucks stores. i don't like being asked for my name in the drive thru. it does not make me feel connected to baristas as a customer; it just feels like a hassle. i would like to just place my order and continue with my day.""

3039,starbucks,"i was hired 3-4 weeks ago and was really excited to start working at sbux. i came in to do my i-9 a few days later and was told i'll be scheduled for training in a couple days but then never heard from my sm for almost 2 weeks even after reaching out. 


after 2 weeks my sm finally texted me at 11:30pm to come in the next day at 5am for training. i should have just said no, but i was desperate at that point. best part - my manager wasn't even there when i got there and the sup made me do learning modules on his account because i didn't have a partner login or number yet. my sm took me off the schedule after that and told me i'll be trained somewhere else. it took her another 1.5 weeks to get me that schedule and when i showed up no one was aware that i was there for training. 


i haven't done any modules on my own account, i don't have an apron, i haven't done orientation yet or the first sip thing and know nothing about food safety but they threw me on pos, warming and order support all day by myself with only a few minutes of in person training. i got in trouble for not knowing how to sequence ringing up customers, warming and making drinks correctly during rush. 


i was completely overwhelmed because that store is extremely busy and has a drive through. the worst part was that the supervisor/trainer got annoyed whenever i had a question.

3053,starbucks,"so like most starbucks locations, or back room is very small. when i came into work today and the order arrived, we had so much food that the fridges were full and we had about two pallets of food sitting in our back room. the ac is also broken. on top of that, morning crew has not been putting dates on the food currently in the fridges, so we weren’t even sure what was supposed to go out or not. we ended up cycling stuff out of the fridge and putting the new stuff in the fridge and then leaving the “older” food out. i absolutely detest wasting food and we do not have anybody that picks up our food for donations, plus again the ac is broken, therefore the food would need to be thrown away. so naturally, we divided the food up amongst ourselves and still had way too much left over.

my dilemma is this: i’m not sure if i’m going to get in trouble for what i did. i called my dad, who works on a military base, to come pick up a lot of the food so he can share it with his coworkers. there are no homeless shelters in my city that i’m aware of either. i also called my aunt, who does not have much money, to come get what was left. 

i did not profit from this nor was there anything we could’ve done to keep the food cold enough for customers. partners have taken home boxes of food in the past with no trouble after because apparently this is a common issue here. i guess i’m just worried that even though i figure i was doing the right thing, i could get in trouble. and i really need my health insurance for school and transitioning.

noted it was just me and her and a shift supervisor that constantly singles me out because i raise concerns for the things he has us do ( for instance making me do bathrooms and drive through at the same time even though they’re across the store and then getting mad at me for taking an hour to do bathrooms because i was at the drive through half the time) also he’s a new shift. 

my confusion is why i’m being written up because the girl didn’t seem mad at me the next day. she was still joking and talking to me. 

i also find it incredibly unprofessional that i haven’t been officially told i’m being written up the shift who does like me and the one that was there the day i said it was telling people other than shifts that i’m being written up. the only reason i know is because my friend told me he told him. 

the thing the errks me is that this is the first time i’ve ever said something that made someone mad or uncomfortable. i wasn’t even told not to say it or that it actually offended her so i could give an apology i’m just being written up without a warning or without any other kind of discussion with me. i want to apologize because i don’t want to hurt anyone i was just trying to make them laugh and the joke wasn’t at their expense.

we are being overworked while not getting enough hours to feed ourselves. i have coworkers who struggle to feed their kids. i have coworkers who can't afford rent. all of this so that people quit.

all of this to do their hardest to go back on their promise of paying us what isn't even a living wage anymore. they can spare the 50% off to make our shifts living hell, but they refuse to give us what we are owed. it is the baristas who make your drinks, not the people sitting in corporate who are happy to watch their store employees struggle to survive.",dear customers of starbucks

3102,starbucks,"domestic violence and child abuse trigger warning!!!

i’m writing this because i need advice, it might be a little long but i think it’s important. if anyone reads this, i appreciate it. 

this morning in the midst of a rush i was informed by one of my shifts that someone was beating/hitting their child in our parking lot inside of their truck. i was immediately shocked (i have a personal history with child abuse and this comment hit home) but my shift said that we can’t do anything about it. this immediately brought up red flags in my brain and i say that if she sends me on a 10 or has someone swap me out for a bit (i was on drive through bar and the line was long so i couldn’t just walk off the floor, at least not without reprimand) i’d go call the police. she said it’s not an option because our store manager (who was also working at the time and in the store) would not let us call the police and in fact would get mad at us if we did. she then proceeded to tell me a story about how in the past one of my other shift supervisors called the police when he saw a man choking out his wife in his car and that our manager got mad at him. by the time she finished telling me this story the car had driven off and no one had done anything about what we had witnessed.

i’m shocked. i’ve been working this job for two years and i would never ever imagine nor was i ever told that we couldn’t call the police if we witnessed abuse or any other sort of crime. is my manager right? we’re not allowed to? this honestly makes me want to quit. 

is this something i should or could go to hr or ethics &amp; compliance about? because i find this just incorrigibly wrong. besides, in general, shouldn’t a situation like this go beyond our “responsibility” to the job? because i think it should—someone’s life is in danger. i mean, if someone’s bold enough to hit or choke someone in public imagine how bad it is in private. i feel guilty that i didn’t do anything about it. there’s a scared little kid out there that i could’ve helped and that breaks my heart.

it’s just amazing to me that handing out a free item or drink to a homeless person would get me in trouble but because this guy enforces laws (barely) he gets something for free? we don’t give social workers free coffee, or health care workers, or teachers so why the fuck? why do we feel the need to fucking bootlick so hard?",starbucks does not care about their communities

since i've already scheduled an interview for this friday, i was wondering if i should just stick it out and discuss my situation with the manager or if i should just try my luck elsewhere. i don't wanna unnecessarily waste my time going to an interview if i have no intention of taking the job, though.

• says we have to find coverage if we're sick, unless we have multiple covid symptoms 
• has already picked favorites and its very obvious

• tells other ssvs that they are unhappy with a certain shifts closes but won't say it to their face

3140,starbucks,"so i always get the same drink. i never switch it up. 

iced-coffee, no classic, sugar-free vanilla, half &amp; half (instead of milk). 

so i know what it’s supposed to taste like. i can tell by the first sip whether it’s a good one or a bad one. 

lately, it’s been hit or miss and i have no idea why. 

the weird taste is hard to describe. i just know…it’s bad. kind of sour, but not overly so. sometimes it’s kind of…strawberry-y or banana-y (no, i don’t think it’s a case of cross contamination). again, it’s a hard taste to describe. 

i’m thinking that it could be the iced-coffee itself. 

i always have the store make the drink, but last month i was just buying the iced-coffee because i had the syrup &amp; cream at home (same exact brand of cream &amp; exact starbucks brand syrup). 

some days when i would “make this at home”, it would have that same weird taste. but not every time!

that’s why i’m thinking it’s the iced-coffee (as opposed to the cream or syrup being off). 

but why would the iced-coffee taste bad? if that’s even the case. 

again, it’s not every day, but once a week for sure i get a funky-tasting drink and it goes right down the sink. 

and i wouldn’t even know how to describe it to the baristas. “can you please re-make this? it tastes…wrong.” 😅

it’s always the same store/staff as well and i love them all so much!

3147,starbucks,"one thing i really struggled with when i first got hired was learning which syrups went in which drinks (standard recipe), and i could never find the answers anywhere. tbh, i’m still unsure i got all of them down lol, and i feel like as baristas we’re all constantly learning. feel free to answer in the comments, just as a guide for any fellow baristas:

what are all of the drinks that get classic syrup?

what are all of the drinks that get vanilla syrup? (this one especially since there are so many)

what are all of the drinks that get caramel syrup?

3150,starbucks,"hi. so i went to starbucks today and reloaded money to my account since it was at zero. i haven’t had a physical starbucks card in probably 5+ years. i just use the app and have my cc linked to it. i have the app require my thumb print to unlock.

i saw an order for a bagel that i know i didn’t purchase so i started digging and see that there has been more than 5 in store purchases over the last week with charges to my starbucks card and credit card on file…. the store they were charged to were in western canada and i live on the east coast of america. i haven’t been to canada in the last decade. i removed my cc from my account and will be calling starbucks tomorrow.

my question is how is this possible? how can they be able to scan my starbucks virtual account in another country. my account requires my thumb print to access on my phone. i’m just very confused how this happened. now i’m paranoid and need to go check my cc’s for purchases. anyone have something similar happen?",account hacked question

3159,starbucks,"story time of a customer i had today: 
immediately she's yelling for my attention at the box just for her to tell me (rudely) to give her a minute to look at the menu. she then takes 3 mins to order each of her drinks. every time i ask her a clarifying question about how she wants her drink, she continues to make it more complicated and starts getting frustrated at me even though i want to make sure her order is correct. at this point she has about like 8 items that she's ordering and has been at the window for like 15 mins, and says ""you know what if i need to add anymore drinks i'll just tell you at the window,"" and then drives away before i can even read her whole order back to her. when she finally comes to the window, she continues to give me an attitude while i am trying to take her payment. at first, she shows me one of her gift cards that has 12 dollars on it and after i scan it, she says, ""wait a second! cancel that, i want to reload 35 onto my card,"" and hands me 40 dollars. i cancel the gift card payment so i can save the order and reload 35 onto her starbucks card that has no money on it. i was thinking to myself that it was kind of weird that she wanted to add money to a card that had no money on it since she'd still have to pay the remaining balance. and when i scanned the reloaded card, she still had a remaining balance and i told her that she still owes 9 dollars and some change. she then got mad at me because she had just reloaded her card and said it should have been enough because i scanned the 12 dollar gift card before hand. i had to remind her that she wanted to reload onto a different card and told me to cancel the gift card payment. if she had given me the correct card (the 12 dollar gift card) to scan in the first place and reload onto that card, there wouldn't be a remaining balance. (both cards were on her app). she didn't seem to want to listen but begrudgingly gave me her gc to scan for the remaining balance. i had switched off onto my break before she got her drinks and i am just glad i didn't have to keep dealing with her.",anyone have any difficult customer stories they want to share?
3160,starbucks,"so i currently work at a target starbucks, and i really want to leave and work at an actual starbucks store, i started an application a few days ago, everything was fine, and then i had to save the draft because i had to go do something else. either i didn't do that correctly or the site is buggy, but when i logged back in to continue my application i wasn't able to edit anything. i just withdrew the application but now i can't reapply? help 😭",i'm having difficulty trying to apply to this job
3161,starbucks,"so, yesterday one of our lovely customers decided to .. leave us a gift on the floor of the bathroom, and then step in it and walk all around our lobby. a lady saw it when she went to use the bathroom, came out and just said “theres a situation in there”. my manager was on his half and i figured it was probably just a lot of toilet paper, maybe pee on the seat. nope. i walk to the bathroom and see what look like dirt footprints. i open the door and am assaulted by the worst smell of my life, i almost puked. we then had to close the cafe down and only do mobile orders at the door while we waited 4 hours for someone to come. this was end of day and we only had 3 partners including our manager. why me!!!",💩y situation

3163,starbucks,"hi! my name's michael and recently i went to starbucks for the first time

it's really cool and i love the insane amount of customisability it gives you, but one thing confused me: what's the purpose of a machiatto?

i know this isn't a starbucks-exclusive question but i was going to buy it there so i thought i should ask it too.

from the definition of it it sounds like it's just taste like espresso for the first part, and the rest just be milk. is this the case or is there something i've missed?

thanks",why would i buy a machiatto?
