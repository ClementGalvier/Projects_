pumpkin medium: $2.29

original medium: $2.75

pumpkin large: $2.59

original large: $2.99

pumpkin extra large: $2.79

it's an absurd price difference. surely the sweetener is more expensive than the coffee?",how come the pumpkin coffee is less expensive than black coffee?
1,DunkinDonuts,"a few weeks ago someone posted a comment about changing the zip code in the app to 90001 to get in early on the new rewards program (which sucks) and getting a free medium coffee by doing so. well, i did it and now i cannot change it back to my actual zip code, 2838 miles to the east. not only have i not been able to get the free medium coffee but any of the reward offers ive selected are redeemable in california only. ive tried deleting and re-installing app &amp; accessing account on-line to change it but the zip code field is locked. i will email their customer support but i figured i would as here first. thanks",dunkin app zip code issue
2,DunkinDonuts,"our nearest dunkin is a bit of a drive, and the flavorings available to buy in the stores are garbage.   would like to be able to replicate their hazelnut flavored iced coffee at home when we can't get to dunkin.",can you buy the unsweetened flavors dunkin uses?
3,DunkinDonuts,"how do i ask for an extra shot of flavor in the mobile app? i get medium coconut iced, 2 creams (or, large with 4 creams depending on how dead i am lol)‚Ä¶ you can ask for less flavor shots but not more. am i missing something? i keep meaning to ask when i go in to pick up my order, but it‚Äôs always so crazy and i don‚Äôt have time before work to stand on line and wait to ask. tia!",mobile app ordering question

8,DunkinDonuts,"i was at a local dunkin at the beginning of the month @ saw a sign that said on september 1st, teachers can get a free coffee. i want to say it was a small or medium hot or iced. i haven‚Äôt been back that way recently to look at it again, but also haven‚Äôt seen any other local dunkin advertising this promo. does anyone know anything about this? for context, i‚Äôm in upstate (central) ny. thanks!",9/1 promo
9,DunkinDonuts,"this is probably a strange question, but do workers assemble the breakfast sandwiches themselves or do they come frozen and pre-made? our usual dunkin has been closed for the last three months for remodeling and we‚Äôve been going to a different one. about once a week, we get breakfast from there and the sandwiches seem so different at the other location. ours just opened back a few days ago and it got me wondering about the sandwiches.",do workers make the sandwiches?
10,DunkinDonuts,if i had the dunking app can i scan my code for free points every time i take someone‚Äôs order?! i thought about it and it wouldn‚Äôt harm the customers but i have been told i would get in ‚Äúbig trouble‚Äù by coworkers?! it‚Äôs whatever tho,infinite food hack??

17,DunkinDonuts,so it seems dunkin pulled a fast one and put the pumpkin spice in the cold foam instead of the drink itself. how would you fix the cold foam on the app to actually have pumpkin? no wonder they're offering it for $3 till november.,how would you fix the pumpkin spice cold foam?
18,DunkinDonuts,"how much is extra cream cheese? it‚Äôs not an option on the app to to get extra but recently  i‚Äôve been getting the garden veggie and i usually want a little extra. the first few times they would just throw an extra in the bag, but recently a worker said it cost money, 1.75. then the next day another worker said it was 1.80? does anyone know the answer??",extra cream cheese?
19,DunkinDonuts,"i can't drink regular milk or cream as i am lactose intolerant. usually i just stick to a regular iced coffee but i really enjoy a frozen one but out of 4 locations, only 2 actually made my coffee with oatmilk. the other 2 said they don't make any frozen drinks with oat or almond milk. almond i can understand as it's a big allergy risk. but are they just lying to avoid making this drink for me?",why is it some locations will make my frozen coffee with oatmilk and some won't?

27,DunkinDonuts,"recently, i have noticed that a lot of times whipped cream is not listed under add ons, but whatever location i'm ordering from, always has it. when i mention it to the employee at the store they never say they have heard this from other customers so i'm not sure if anyone else has this issue. i just got a new phone a few days ago and thought maybe having to install the app on this new phone would solve it, but nope. anyone else having this issue?",whipped cream not listed in add ons
28,DunkinDonuts,"now it's pumpkin time and they have cake batter swirls too. recently it's bad i'm doing 2 pump caremel, 2pimps sugar and 2 mil is this too much sugar? should i just do 2 pumps of carmel and 2 milk but it doesn't taste that good then. also if someone can answer exactly how much sugar is in one pump caremel or other syrups if i'd o pumpkin or cake",how exactly do i order a healthy medium ice caremel latte?

30,DunkinDonuts,"i recently switched from ordering iced coffee with milk and sugar to cold brew with milk and the brown sugar cinnamon swirl. 

when i would order iced coffee, i would usually ask for 1 or 2 skim milk in a medium, otherwise my drink would be basically beige. however since switching to cold brew, if i put 3 skim milk in a medium it looks almost black and all i can taste is the coffee and flavor swirl. 

is milk portioned differently between drink types or is my store just making my drink wrong? or does skim milk just not work in cold brew?",different milk portions for iced coffee vs cold brew?
31,DunkinDonuts,"so i went to try the new blood orange refresher and when i ordered i was told that it can only be with coconut milk???? the employee said that she wasn‚Äôt aloud to sell the concentrate without coconut milk? i‚Äôm so confused since it‚Äôs literally promoted without it.

32,DunkinDonuts,"i'm asking because i do like dd coffee when done right. i don't want to sound like everyone sucks or every store is like this. my only experience is with my store here by my house. 

sometimes i don't need a shot of espresso cause the strength is great, and other times i regret not getting the shot. sometimes my coffee is white as cream and other times it looks normal. i always order in store. 

i try to be understanding, and i feel so awkward going so often (1x a week for remakes). what can i do on my part to make sure my coffee stays consistent? i get 1 butterpecan, no added sugar, and 2 milk. i will add my own sweetnlow after i get my drink.",how strong is the iced coffee or cold brew supposed to be?
33,DunkinDonuts,"i was absolutely in love with the cold brew with the brown sugar cinnamon cold foam. 
sadly it is not available now so yesterday i got the cold brew with pumpkin foam and brown sugar swirl instead.  all i have to say about it is, ‚Äúyuck‚Äù!  big disappointment. the foam had little flavor and the consistency was different. i wouldn‚Äôt order it again.  i miss my brown sugar cold foam drink.  i haven‚Äôt tried the cold brew with sweet cold foam yet.  any good?

35,DunkinDonuts,"with the rewards change, my birthday reward was 3x bonus points on all purchases for the day. i thought maybe they would send an offer for a free drink after the fact but nope, just the bonus 3x points for the rest of the day? this is pretty lame if they really changed this but this is in line with what peets did (25 points added to account) when they changed rewards systems.",no more birthday drinks with updated rewards?

46,DunkinDonuts,"i have an interview with dunkin donuts in a few days. the job is a crew member. my responsibilities will include but will not be limited to thoroughly cleaning tables, obeying safety and sanitation guidelines, handling cash register transactions and pouring coffee. 

i have done research to find out what types of questions i can expect to receive during the interview. below is a list of possible questions and the answers i have drafted. i will gladly accept any feedback. it is doubtful that every single one of these questions would be asked, but some of them will and i don‚Äôt know which ones will and which ones won‚Äôt be asked, so i need to be prepared. please focus not on how likely it is that i will be asked these questions, but on whether or not the answers i have drafted would make sense had these questions been asked. 

**what are your strengths**?

i am a quick learner. i am enthusiastic and hungry to learn. furthermore, i take criticism really well. if i have done something wrong, i want to be told what i did wrong. therefore, you will never have to worry about me making the same mistake twice. 

**what is your biggest weakness**? 

with what little work experience i have, i am a work in progress. however, being so new to this profession, i can be shaped into the perfect employee. 

**what are your career goals**?

at the moment, i am in a discovery phase. in an attempt to find myself, i want a job that will remind me about the value of hard work and enable me to challenge myself. i hope to be able to multitask, so that i may learn, grow and develop. 

**where do you see yourself five years from now**? 

five years from now, i plan to still be working here. hopefully, i will have contributed to the company enough to be seen as a trusted and reliable member of my team. while still in the ame role, i would have a wide range of responsibilities. i would be the go to person for advice and expertise in my area. 

**when are you available to work**?

i am available to work anytime. 

**tell me about yourself**.

there is so much to tell, it is hard to know where to begin. 

in undergrad, i completed an internship working on nightly and weekend programming. this job enabled me to work with students who had learning disabilities. i would help to coordinate events. i would help with the set up and clean up. during the event itself, i would interact with the students and ensure that they were having a good time and obeying all school rules. if i am hired to work at dunkin donuts, it would be my job to ensure that the customers have a pleasant experience. 

**walk me through your resume**.  

i have done landscaping jobs before. i once shovelled snow out of the driveway of a customer who was unable to shovel himself due to back problems. i was self-employed and the pay was not steady. i had to seek out opportunities for work. i did not have the same sense or order that i would have at a job that takes place in a building where i punch in and punch out. that is why i would like a job like this, where i am told when to show up and what to do when i am here. 

i recently finished school. my major was psychology. i knew that the courses that i took in school were no guarantee of figuring out what i wanted to do with my life. however, by understanding human nature, i would be able to better understand the world, which would help me connect with people and figure out how to find work. 

my last semester of undergrad, i worked an unpaid internship on nightly and weekend programming for the thames program. the thames program at mitchell college is a program for students with learning disabilities. i assisted with the prep work, set up and cleaned up for many events. during these events, i would interact with and act as a role model for younger students. as an intern, there was a degree of creativity involved with the job, but for the most part, i followed orders given to me by my supervisor. i foresee this job as one that is mostly about obeying an employer. i intend to set up the place to open and/or clean up the place before leaving after closing. 

**how did you hear about this job**?

i received an email notification from indeed.com. i like challenges. this job is physically demanding, because you have to lift objects that weigh as much as 35 pounds. the job is also socially challenging, you must greet customers and ensure that people have a pleasant experience when the people in question are complete strangers and you do not know what they like. this job sounds challenging in a good way. this job sounds exactly like a challenging task i have been looking for this whole time. 

**why do you want to work at this company**? 

i want to work at dunkin donuts, because the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. 

this restaurant's target demographic is the working class. these are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. i take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average american. 

**why should we hire you**? 

my biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that i am a team player. in a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. having majored in behaviour science in undergrad, i have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. when i did community service for sacred heart school in taftville, i would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. therefore, i know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. also, i was a student-athlete in high school. from this experience, i built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**when did you have to work under stress? how did you handle it**?

when i completed an internship in undergrad, i had to complete 100 hours by the end of the semester. i dealt with that stress the same way i dealt with any other form of stress, by using the one year rule. if ever i am stressed about anything, i simply ask myself, will this still be on my mind in a year? if the answer is no, then logically there is no reason to be worried, as it will all blow over in 365 days or less. if, however, the answer is yes, then there is still no reason to be worried, as even if things do not go as planned, there will be plenty more opportunities to rectify what went wrong. i also ask myself this one question. what is the worst thing that can happen? stress is what you feel when you are not sure what the outcome will be and you know that the outcome could be undesirable. when you take a driving test, you feel stressed, because you might not pass. if you ask yourself what the worst thing that can happen is, you may be surprised to discover that the worst thing that can happen is not only pretty unlikely to happen in the first place, if it were to happen, it would not be that bad. 

**do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team**? 

i like to work as part of a team. i also enjoy working alone with close supervision. when i did my internship in college, i would interact with my supervisors, the other interns and my teacher. it was all up to me to ensure that i fulfilled my responsibilities. i was supervised in regards to the jobs that i did for the school, but it was my responsibility to ensure that my work was completed in time. 

**how would you deal with a conflict**?

if ever i dealt with a conflict, whether it be work related or inter personal, i would say to the other person the following; 

‚Äúit seems to me that you are upset or angry that something has been done wrong. would you please tell me what i have done wrong, why it was wrong and what, if anything, can be done to improve the situation?‚Äù 

that is verbatim what i would say in response to a complaint.

**how would you remain motivated in your work**?

i consistently ask myself; am i a better person than i was a year ago? and what do i need to do to become better over the course of the next 365 days? i think of it in terms of years, not days. everyone has bad days. you don‚Äôt know if you will improve from one day to the next, but there is no excuse for regressing from one year to the next. 

**what is your ideal working environment**?

my ideal working environment is one where everyone makes it a priority to build others up. no one is perfect. when a fellow worker makes a mistake, the appropriate response is to either correct the mistake or teach the person who made the mistake to correct it himself or herself. this expectation should apply in all directions, employee toward employer, employer toward employee and employee toward other employee.  

**is there anything you have done in the past that you wish you had done differently**? 

when i did community service for sacred heart school, i was tasked with vacuuming the carpets. i unplugged the vacuum cleaner before turning it off. i received a shock.  

**if you have a day when you are not busy, what would you do**?

i would ask my supervisor if anything else needs to be done, hoping he or she has a task for me. 

**why is it important for all policies and standards to be obeyed**?

policies, procedures and standards are set in place with the intent to work toward a common goal. if some people in a staff or faculty disobey policies, a common goal will never be achieved. 

**when can you start? when are you available**?

i am capable of beginning immediately. i am available to work any shift. 

**are you able to travel**? 

although i do not have my own vehicle, i will have transportation for scheduled shifts. 

**do you have any experience working in fast food**? 

i do not. 

**why are you interested in working with us**? 

i am a regular customer of dunkin donuts. every product, the donuts, coffee, hot chocolate, and breakfast sandwiches are amazing. i am impressed by the quality of the products, not to mention the customer service. if i work here, i can spread joy through a cup of coffee and make customers loyal to the brand. furthermore, the fast paced environment is my ideal workplace. 

**what do you know about the company**? 

when william rosenberg founded dunkin donuts in 1950, the company first did business in quincy massachusetts. the slogan ‚Äúamerica runs on dunkin‚Äù is accurate. it is the most popular coffee seller in the country, measured by the number of coffee cups sold. dunkin donuts sells over 2 billions cups of coffee in a single calendar year. 

**why us and not our competitors**? 

as a loyal customer of dunkin donuts, i know that dunkin donuts produces products of much higher quality at a lower price compared to other companies. year after year, dunkin donuts has not dropped in quality at all. the clientele is very diverse and should provide an opportunity to meet new people and learn new things. this restaurant's target demographic is the working class. these are the people who come here to get a coffee and a sausage egg and cheese sandwich right before work. i take great joy in my genuine desire to make life easier or more convenient for the average american. 

**why should we hire you**? 

my biggest strength and potential contribution to the company would have to be that i am a team player. in a restaurant staff, it is expected that we, as workers, take care of our own and put the needs of the customers first. having majored in behaviour science in undergrad, i have learned how to get along with people and work as a team. when i did community service for sacred heart school in taftville, i would be assigned a task and expected to do it under a time constraint, as the cafeteria was supposed to be used by someone else for something else at an allotted time. therefore, i know how to not only do a good job, but complete a job by a strict deadline. also, i was a student-athlete in high school. from this experience, i built up stamina and learned to multi-task. 

**how would you deal with an unsatisfied customer**? 

i would offer my condolences, ask why the experience was unpleasant and ask what, if anything, i am capable of doing to remedy the situation so that it never occurs again. if it is possible to fulfil the customer‚Äôs request while obeying the rules set in place by my employer, i will do so. 

**can you work under pressure**? 

i can definitely work under pressure. pressure makes me a more competent worker. when i completed an internship in undergrad, the knowledge that i had to complete 100 hours of service by the end of the semester gave me the incentive i needed to reach out to people and ask if there were any favours they needed. when my professor told me that failure to complete 100 hours would result in an f for the course and course credit being withheld, i immediately knew that i needed to reach out and seek opportunities as soon as possible. 

**what do you foresee being the biggest challenge at this job**? 

i have always wanted to work here and never given much thought to the challenges that are likely to come up. i imagine i will face the typical challenges associated with a fast paced environment. i am sure that it will be nothing unsolvable. when i face a challenge or i am out of my comfort zone, there is no need to talk about how uncomfortable i am. my discomfort is my problem, no one else‚Äôs. i will deal with the discomfort myself one time. when talking to others i will focus on the positive. 

**what would you do if a customer asked to speak to the manager**? 

i would first ask what the problem is and whether or not i can help. if i can help, i will. if, however, i lack the ability to solve the problem myself or the customer insists on seeing the manager, then i will get the manager immediately. 

**how reliable are you**? 

i pride myself in always showing up and time, doing my best and receiving all the constructive criticism that is useful to me. if i am unable to show up, i intend to give my employer and coworkers notice well in advance. 

**how do you intend to provide excellent customer service**? 

i will always provide service with a smile. in other words, have a positive perky attitude when greeting a customer. i will lead the customer to a seat for an in house order. to ensure that the customer is attended to in a timely manner, i will be sure to sit or stand in a location where i can easily identify a customer and a customer could easily identify me. 

**what would you do if you caught a fellow employee stealing from the cash register**? 

i do not tolerate unethical behaviour such as stealing. i will report the theft in such a way as standard procedure dictates. this is rarely an issue for me in the first place, as the vast majority of people who i have ever met have proper respect for other people‚Äôs property. 

**how do you achieve proper work-life balance**? 

when i am not at work, i throw myself into my hobbies. i enjoy athletic activities like hiking, leisure activities like playing video games and intellectually stimulating activities such as reading classic novels and writing movie reviews. 

**what would you do if a customer ordered in house and refused to pay**? 

i hope i never have to deal with that, but should such an unfortunate circumstance arise, i would speak to security or management, who are trained to handle such situations. 

**what have you done to better your understanding of this field in the last five years**? 

in school, i took several classes in psychology and marketing. this taught me a lot about the economy, customer service, human nature and how to behave professionally. 

**how would you prioritise tasks during a busy period**?

the customer always comes first. 

if i am in the middle of setting a table and a party enters as the phone is ringing, i would drop what i am doing, escort the customer to their table, answer the phone and then finish setting the table in that order. 

**how do you intend to blend with our existing team**? 

i have pretty good communication and people skills. i respect people‚Äôs boundaries. if the employee is more experienced than i am, i will look to him or her for guidance

49,DunkinDonuts,"is this just me? i get dunkin multiple times a week and more often than not, the cup fails to do what its meant to do. every time i tilt the cup and take a sip, 6 or 7 drops start dripping down the side. ive had to use wet wipes on my center console 2x this week",leaking coffee with every sip
50,DunkinDonuts,"hi dunkin,

i have a dunkin‚Äô donuts near my place of work, where i pick up ‚Äúcold brews‚Äù 2-5 times a week. i‚Äôm not a huge coffee snob, but i did work at dunkin in college, and can easily distinguish between cold brew and iced coffee. dunkin‚Äôs iced coffee is much more bitter, more watered down, a slightly lighter color, and leaves bean dust floating in the bottom of your drink. cold brew, being around a dollar more, is higher quality and tastes better (imo).

so i guess here‚Äôs where the snobbiness comes in‚Ä¶ i can tell that i often get iced coffee in my ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù, and it quite honestly ruins my day. some days it‚Äôs just straight undrinkable, or full of bean floaties, or an odd grayish color (presumably because it‚Äôs watered down remaining iced coffee). i‚Äôve tried clarifying that it is cold brew, i‚Äôve tried asking the cashier if they still have cold brew before i order, i‚Äôve even asked the barista which they used. i have never asked for a remake, and i‚Äôm really trying to avoid that, but i will lose my freaking mind if i wind up with another ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù that tastes like coffee piss on ice.

when it comes down to it, if the cashier would honestly tell me that cold brew was out, i simply wouldn‚Äôt buy it that day. i‚Äôm much more a starbucks gal, but this dunkin is the sole remaining covid survivor in my area. it‚Äôs my only option for coffee i didn‚Äôt make myself. i‚Äôm not trying to be an asshole, i definitely don‚Äôt want to make the employees miserable‚Ä¶.. but how on earth can i get them to be honest with me about the contents of the ‚Äúcold brew‚Äù, and is there any way to avoid a weekly gamble? is it okay to complain? is it fine to ask for a remake/ refund? i know i hated remaking drinks, but then again, i took the high road and told my customers when i was out of cold brew‚Ä¶.

anyway, friendly reminder to all, customers can tell the difference when you sub in the cheaper products. if you‚Äôre out of something, please be honest. if you mess up, please correct it. all i want is my cashier to honestly tell me when they‚Äôre out of cold brew - that‚Äôs it. but instead, i get constant promises that it is indeed cold brew‚Ä¶. and half the time, it‚Äôs not.",consistently given iced coffee instead of cold brew?
51,DunkinDonuts,"ok, tell me this isn‚Äôt weird. almost every time i go to my local dunkin, they take a huge, banged up metal pan, shove it through the window and scrape the asphalt with it after a car drives off. after several times seeing them do this, i asked the guy why. he said that they do it to ‚Äúgrab the change that fell on the ground‚Äù ??? but each time i see them do it, there is no change in the ground and they sure as hell ain‚Äôt picking it up with that thing.",local dunkin scrapes metal pan on ground at drive-thru

57,DunkinDonuts,"might trigger some people but i don't like the pumpkin at allüòÇ is there any way to manipulate the pumpkin cold brew or pumpkin spice latte to have more of a caramel taste; like for example taking out the cold foam that has a pumpkin taste and adding 2 swirls of caramel in there?

and while i don't go to dunkin for the food, it's nice on occasion. an egg and cheese sandwich (no meat!) is $6.03. that's just unreasonable.

what do the basics cost at your dunkin, and what price would be the breaking point for you?",how expensive is too expensive?
112,DunkinDonuts,"this is just me ranting, but i'm losing my mind.

when i first started working at dunkin, i loved it. there were some hiccups, with me not quite being trained properly, but once i learned everything it was awesome. i liked my coworkers, hell i even liked my manager most days. we all worked well as a team and everything, for the most part, ran smoothly. 

but then our manager quit , and they hired a new manager. although she claims to have prior experience as a dunkin manager, i swear to god she has no idea what she's doing. everyone here welcomed her and tried to help her adjust to the store (our store had been renovated recently so we had a few machines that were different to what she was used to), and she was great.. for a few days.

 i had a week off for a vacation soon after she joined, and when i came back everything had gone to hell. i wish i was exaggerating when i say 75% of my coworkers had already quit, without even a 2 weeks notice. from what i heard over text, she wasn't listening to the hours people said they could work and was scheduling people when they weren't at all available, but then getting mad when they said they couldn't come in. a few times, she left a gap in the schedule where no one was scheduled to be in the store. the store, left completely unattended, for several hours. machines were breaking because she refused to learn how to use them properly. she'd come on the floor to ""help"", make a mess, and then leave and expect everyone else to clean it up. and in my experience since i've come back, it's all true. i've specifically said i cannot, under any circumstances, work opening shifts. last week she scheduled me for exclusively opening. i texted her, again, to tell her i couldn't, and she told me i had to ""figure it out and find someone to cover."" i switched with a girl who said she couldn't do closing shifts and only got closing shifts. 

now that we're constantly understaffed, we're all just trying our best and, yes, we're taking shortcuts. shoot me, sometimes i'll make a latte right in the cup instead of putting it in the metal tin first. or i'll bounce between stations instead of sticking to one because we don't have enough people to staff every station! and when i'm closing i have to leave my coworker out on the floor by herself to go to the back to do closing chores because we don't have anyone else to help. but she is constantly nitpicking everything and saying it's ""not standard!!"" but it's literally the only way we can get through the day anymore.

i came in yesterday, and said hello to her on my way in. without even saying hello or good morning or anything, the first thing she said to me, at 6 in the fucking morning, was ""why did it take you more than 10 minutes to do boxes yesterday?"" it was truck day, i had literally an entire stores worth of supplies that we had unpacked from boxes, and all of those boxes had to be broken down. anyone who works at dunkin knows that is dozens of boxes, and most of them are too big to fit in the dumpster at all so they have to be cut and well broke down before they can be taken out. and that's not including the 2 minutes each way it takes to pull the trashcan to the dumpster, and you usually need at least 2-3 trips (if not more). and i told her all of this, and she said she didn't care, and that next time she caught me ""wasting time"" she'd suspend me.

the only thing keeping me here at this point is that almost no one in the area is hiring, and the very few people that are hiring are hiring for jobs that i am so not qualified for. but i swear i've never felt more mentally drained.",thinking about quitting
113,DunkinDonuts,"this also applies to most other meal delivery services.


baskin robbins has a core set of flavors that we must keep at all times, and a rotating monthly array of the other ones determined by both dunkin brands and the franchisee. this is also true for toppings, ltos and niche items such as mangonadas. 


**doordash does not recognize that the flavors change and will show all of them as available!**


as such, when the order comes in, we must wait for the driver to come by, let them know the missing items and hope that the customer answers their phone. if they can't answer the phone, the driver cancels and another is sent over and over until either the customer picks up their phone, we decide to substitute something similar and write a note, or the customer cancels on their end.


at least at my location, we cannot cancel orders on our end for doordash. so please either call ahead to ask us what we have or be ready to answer the doordasher's call/text! it makes the situation much smoother and easier for all parties involved (plus you get your stuff faster!)

127,DunkinDonuts,"i just became a baker and i am curious what your normal night looks like. i started this last week and a brand new location. they had said my hours would be a specific time, roughly 7 hour shifts. 

so far i have been baking and frosting roughly 600-700 donuts, plus croissants, bagels, muffins, munchkins. by the time i just get everything glazed and and frosted i am usually at roughly 11 hours, and they also expect me to put all the baked goods in their respective places and then wash all the trays and sweep and mop the store. which takes about another hour and a half or so. i just don‚Äôt see how any of this is remotely possible. they also said as time goes by they expect production to go up once people get used to the new location being there. i have been doing 12-13 hour shifts to finish things and i am absolutely miserable. 

is it like this everywhere? do other locations have multiple people baking? i know some locations get their donuts delivered so not every store bakes their own. 

any tips?",question for any bakers out there

129,DunkinDonuts,"although working at dunkin taught me to be kind, generous and polite to people that just want their coffee, the location i worked at was so bad. i worked there for over a year, and there are so many incidents of drunk + high coworkers, bullshit, equipment failing and falling apart and ridiculous amount of hours that were cut from everyone. i finally had enough one day when i was closing from 2:00 to 7:30 (30 hours a week), and my other coworker who only works till 7:00 had the audacity to not only hit on my mom (she was dropping off a car for me to drive back home), but give me a hard time and yelled at me for some stupid shit that i don't want to explain here. i had my two days off and finally had enough and put a 5 days notice because i was just not happy working there anymore. i know i would feel guilty if i hadn't put a notice in but i really wanted to ""give it to the man"" and just walk out, like so many people before.

i managed to save about $4,000 this summer before going to school and hopefully finding a job there instead. dunkin taught me that it cannot be hard to run a business, something i want to do in the future. just be kind, polite and don't put up with any bullshit and you will be successful. i swear you can get anywhere and successful in life just by treating people the way you want to be treated. all in all, we all go through bs in our lives, working at dunkin or not, but its best to just keep moving forward and not give a fuck.",i finally quit
130,DunkinDonuts,"as much as i love dunkin, the app is just frustratingly bad for something that was created by one of the world's most successful coffee chains.

half the time, the app randomly decides to not let me check out---the ""place order"" button turns grey and won't let me do anything. i've found that the only way around this issue is to delete the order and completely re-select everything. 

and don't even get me started on the mess that is the points system. the ""deals"" they have often don't even work. my app currently has the ""mobile order an iced drink on monday and get 100 points"" deal going on right now. so i ordered an iced latte on the app this monday and the points never came through! this isn't the first time that this has happened!

i will say, however, the app sometimes messes up in a good way lmao. for instance, after i redeemed my free birthday drink in-store a couple months ago, the reward never left my app. so the next day, i used it in a mobile order and got a second free drink haha. and then just today, i was using another free drink reward i had. the drink was all that i ordered---so i paid nothing, but my app is trying to say that i spent like $15 in that transaction and gave me 60 free points for it.

158,DunkinDonuts,"today at work was a nightmare. got in at 8am, clock in, and go to beverage 1 where i'm assigned. immediately i notice our ac is down. it's 95 degrees outside, we've only been open four hours but all of the donuts look melted and disgusting.


then i go to make a drink and notice is that the sticker machine is printing the writing huge, so only the first few letters of each ingredient are being shown on the sticker. ex. 1 cre, 2 fre, 4 su instead of 1 cream, 2 french vanilla, 4 sugars. and for frozens it would just say ""(size) frozen"" and we couldn't tell if it was a frozen coffee or frozen hot chocolate. so i had to keep looking on the screen to try and identify what i was making. 


after figuring out what the first drink was i went to put cream in it, only for the dispenser not to shoot anything out (despite at least half full.) i try to use the other machine, same issue. i manually open tiny creamer packets, pour them in, and tell my manager so she knows it's broken.


next i fill a blender to make a frozen, and pass it off to beverage three for them to blend it. i hear them freaking out, look over, and the machine wouldn't stop dispensing ice. it was supposed to make a small coolata but it has completely filled the blender with ice and was still trying to dispense more. we had to shut down the machine and couldn't do frozens again for the rest of the day.


i got swapped to drivethrough later in the day, and noticed that our drivethrough window wasn't automatically shutting like it was supposed to. this would've been fine, seeing as there wasn't ac or anything so it's not like it could get any hotter, except it was rainy and the wind was blowing all the rain into the store. had to keep manually pushing/pulling on the window to get it to close and open.


not only was the rain getting in the store, but it was raining so hard that i was practically screaming into my headset and the people in the drivethrough couldn't hear me still! and then they'd get upset that i wasn't taking their order even though i was trying to, and i had to explain at the window that it was just because of the rain.


then my manager made me take the trash + all the boxes out. in the rain. on truck day, where i had 5 trash cans worth of boxes + 2 trash cans of actual trash.

169,DunkinDonuts,"returned back to work today after my day off, came back to a nice surprise of the big redesign of the dunkin app. 

according to the paper (which i forgot to snap a pic of!) all of the southern california dunkin‚Äôs are going to be the first dunkin‚Äôs in the country to transition from dd perks to dunkin rewards. the transition will happen later this month or next month. 

i saw a post posted yesterday or the day before talking about this change. if you want more information on the transition check out that post, however to summarize the change, more rewards than just a free drink like sandwiches, donuts and more! only downside is the good drinks are all obtainable by acquiring 500+ points making it harder to get to the free drink reward.. 

the paper did not mention when the transition will happen for other dunkin‚Äôs but i cannot imagine it will take long after. dunkin has also shipped shirts for team members to promote the newly designed app.",it‚Äôs official! dd perks ‚Äî&gt; dunkin rewards!
170,DunkinDonuts,"hi!! i‚Äôm going to dunkin today and wanted to try one of these flavor combos: coconut macaron, toffee nut, blueberry cobbler, or chocolate hazelnut truffle. i am having trouble deciding, so if anyone who has tried them could describe them or say which ones they did or didn‚Äôt like it would be greatly appreciated :) sorry if this sounds silly i‚Äôm really indecisive lol",dunkin flavor combo reviews

176,DunkinDonuts,"hey y‚Äôall, i‚Äôm finally getting into coffee and have fallen in love with the swirls, of course. my personal favorite is the butter pecan (y‚Äôall were so right, it hits hard) and the caramel. 

being a broke college student, i can‚Äôt afford to spend $4-$5 a day on coffee and would prefer to make it at home. does anyone have any syrup brand suggestions they‚Äôve really liked? the only one i‚Äôve ever seen in stores is torani branded ones but i can always order off of amazon or something. 

i‚Äôm also looking for suggestions for finding cold foam. is there anywhere anyone has been able to order online? stores around me don‚Äôt carry it unfortunately and i‚Äôd love to be able to add that to my morning coffee as well but i‚Äôm thinking i‚Äôm just out of luck on that one.",caramel swirl alternatives

i‚Äôve been going to the same dunkin probably two to three times a week for the past three years. i will order say a charlie cold foam or a signature pumpkin latte and 9 times out of 10, they don‚Äôt top off the drink with what‚Äôs supposed to be on it. it‚Äôs usually pretty busy in the drive through when i get these drinks so i feel bad giving it back to get fixed and holding everyone up. 

after it happened consistently for a month, i reached out to dunkin corporate, who referred me to the manager, who had me come in for a free drink. i told her i just wanted to be assured that people will just put on the drink what‚Äôs advertised and she said that will be the case from here on out. and it was for like a week, then it just reverted back.

195,DunkinDonuts,"my mother can be a bit much sometimes, honestly i don‚Äôt even know why she bothered to order just a black coffee, but we don‚Äôt have a coffee maker right now so i can‚Äôt shame her on that too much. she likes to claim allergies because she read the ‚Äúhow to karen‚Äù handbook that says apparently claiming allergies will get it absolutely removed, but even still‚Ä¶. i guess i should start at the beginning.

we went to dunkin today because i wanted a coffee since i‚Äôve been up since 5am due to a new medication schedule that ain‚Äôt working for me. we go in because the line in the drive through was a bit long. i ordered my usual(butter pecan with oat milk iced latte), my stepfathers cappuccino blast because ours is the fancy baskin robins conjoined twin, and my mother wants a ‚Äúblack coffee ice blended thingy‚Äù me trying to translate ‚Äújust a blended black coffee‚Äù, she asks for no dairy or sugar of any kind because she is on a ‚Äúdiet‚Äù(and thinks she‚Äôs better than us for it), now i don‚Äôt care about her ordering it without dairy or sugar or anything because if she wants to drink her bitter burnt coffee beans i‚Äôm not going to stop her.
i redeem my free beverage for my drink because why not. we are waiting for our drinks, mine and my stepfathers are finished first, and now we‚Äôre waiting on my mothers. the girl comes over and asks if my mother wants whipped cream, i understand why, some people ask for no dairy or dairy alternatives but still get whipped cream but my mother gets the karen hair up her ass and freaks out ‚Äúi said no cream! i only wanted a frozen blended black coffee!‚Äù despite the fact she knows that i get panic attacks over any person getting outrageously upset, i manage to hold together despite wanting to gag my mother with the dish towel.
well, for some reason the girl becomes very upset over this and cops an attitude. like i can understand my mothers attitude not being the best, not by a very far margin, but the girl began acting like my mother had held her down and called her names.
‚Äúwell you ordered a cappuccino blast.‚Äù the girl first goes ‚Äúthat‚Äôs my husbands yes, i am allergic to dairy!!‚Äù (honestly not sure if she‚Äôs allergic or lactose intolerant like me, she claims she had some joint pain and felt swollen and bloated the last time she had some dairy). i explain my mother just wanted a black coffee blended up with ice, while my mother is freaking out and going ‚Äúi just wanted a black coffee with ice!‚Äù(leaving off the blended part entirely which probably is what spurs this next part), while one girl is going ‚Äúi‚Äôm going to fix this for you ma‚Äôam.‚Äù the girl comes over and slams down a cup of just black ice coffee in front of my mother and walks off. while another girl is explaining that if my mother wanted it blended, it had to be done with dairy or cream in it which honestly doesn‚Äôt even sound right to me, but i don‚Äôt work there so whatever. as we are leaving the girl calls ‚Äúhave a good day ma‚Äôam!‚Äù after my mother as i am trying to herd her out the door.

i am not condoning my mothers attitude, not by a minute, but i do not think this girls attitude was the best either by any mile. i am left wondering if i should even bother complaining?",should i complain?

197,DunkinDonuts,"to put it shortly, i was working for a few days during training time, then was put on a 2 day schedule to work 6 hours, then later given 1 day a week of work for 5 to 12, with some days being 6 to 12 and 7 to 12. then this past month, my boss called and transferred me over to another dunkin but gave me more hours to work. i worked four days from 5 to 12 under a new manager. but after one week with that crew, the manager realized that she had too many people working on the same shift and needed to send some back. so, she sent me back but didn't tell me even though she said she would give me an update friday. i found out sunday of by the district manager that i was sent back and i would get a call from my old manager about the days they will want me to work. 

i got no calls that whole week. i left a message the following monday and got an answer back on tuesday that they're putting me on mondays but are trying to decide what time. i didn't hear anything else the whole week until today that i'm getting mondays but working only four hours. i might come in this coming monday but the scheduling has made me consider quitting, maybe after working that monday. because it feels like a waste of time. they might be oversaturated with workers since it's the summer and this is popular place to get a summer job, and i don't want to deal with high-stress for that low a pay. not again.

i don't know if this is the right move yet because, while i'm not desperate, and i just mostly wanted answers when i called last week to see what was going on, i don't know if it would be the best move to abruptly quit after being given some work hours. i'm of course searching and applying to other jobs but i haven't heard back from any hr reps yet. i also have another job but need extra money to pay off some bills and dunkin pays quicker since it pays weekly. what should i do?",so my hours were reduced to 4 hours on one day a week. might quit. should i?

244,DunkinDonuts,"hey, y'all..

this is my first time posting on this subreddit.

anyway, i started working at my very close dunkins for the past month and a few weeks, and it has been alright. i do overnights and it's just drive-thru only until the front doors are unlocked. the plus side is the pay rate and my awesome co-worker. but once 4 am rolls around, these three guys punch in and are there for the early morning shift. one is a baker, the other is always at sandwich station as the other is there to just open the front doors for eat in and does the necessary morning shift stuff like temperature records, etc. 

so, i've noticed it is just me (a female) working overnight with my co-worker who's a dude. majority of this dunks are all men besides my manager and two-morning shift workers. we are always together doing the work and i refuse to leave my ""space"" on the drive-thru area because these early morning shift guys (the 4 am crew) give me an uncomfortable vibe and i hate the way each of them stares at me when i'm just trying to do my job and i have caught each of them staring at me in a weird way especially when i'm bending over to reach something from the ground level. almost three weeks ago, the guy who is responsible for being on the front counter and opening up, said to me ""maybe i can help you get better sleep"" with a wink after i complained that i will be tired when i get home and even if i try to sleep, i have two kids under the age of 6 who need my care. when he said that, i felt disgusted and gave him a glare and told him that wasn't cool which he laughed off. then a week ago and this week, he purposely tried bumping into me so he can feel my ass while i'm making coffee orders in the drive-thru (he's a big average guy but c'mon, there's still space between us but he makes it seem like its cramped). my co-worker has been observant of this behavior ad has told both my manager and me about it and he hates it because all i'm trying to do is my job and i'm already in a committed relationship with kids. my manager has reported these guys and they each have a history of making other (ex) female employees uncomfortable that they either transferred out of the store or quit. my manager has also spoken to this guy but he's back at it with his lewd comments and giving me that off creep vibes. yesterday after leaving, my co-worker stayed behind to count his register and he heard these guys (including the cleaner and other male crew members) talking about how ""f\*\*\*able"" i look, how my ass looks, etc) and my co-worker snapped at them by \*again\* telling them that i'm 27 and happily taken, and to stop talking about me like that. 

they all laughed at him and kept on with their conversation.

i'm disgusted, repulsed, and don't feel comfortable showing up to work in this kind of environment and i'm sure anyone else will agree. i have vented to my husband about these issues and it has made him very pissed off that before i was ready to clock out this past sunday, he came to pick me up but went straight to the front counter to ask for my manager and she was there and can see how pissed he was and is aware of the situation that she asked him to follow her to her office and talk to him about this and showed him her reports she has made against these guys. all my manager can say is that if i want, i can call hr/corporate directly and just make a complaint or threaten them with a harassment lawsuit because she has made numerous complaints and all these guys get is a ""slap on the wrist"" and my manager's boss has already made it clear that they don't want to fire anyone because the dunks i work at is very short-staffed already..

idk guys, please share your opinions about this or message me privately. i'm to the point of just quitting or relocating but this store is the closest to my apartment and if i chose to be transferred, i know i'm gonna need to travel and don't have a car at this moment.",sexual harassment at the dunks i work at..

259,DunkinDonuts,"i have to share this with someone because this one customer we always get is.. interesting to say the least.

apparently she's a regular, but because of my schedule i've never seen her before. however, my availability changed so ive been working earlier hours, meaning i've started to encounter her.

my first time meeting her was today when i was working drive through. it wasn't super busy and she walked up (yes, walked) to our drivethrough speaker asking for a free water. i said okay, because it's just water and it was a super hot day, and called out to my coworker asking for a medium water. (my stores policy is that we can give away mediums or smalls for free, but larges have to be paid for.) she walks up to the window and i told her like hey, it's really dangerous to be walking in a drivethrough and could you please just come inside? our lobby was open, and i was kinda worried a car would pull through and wouldn't see her (our drivethrough has a weird blind spot, which she was standing right in the middle of). she said no and that she needed her water, so i went to go get it quickly before she got hurt. i brought it out to her and told her to have a good day, before walking away from the window to go do something else.

a few seconds later i hear pounding on our drivethrough window. i go back over and she's slamming her fists on the glass, screaming that she wanted a large. i apologized, told her i wasn't allowed to give away larges for free. she reached in my window to dump the medium onto the floor and said ""no, a large."" i went to get my supervisor and hep was just like ""oh, yeah it's her, just give it to her."" i was just in shock. gave her a large and she went from hysterical to happy in seconds. walked back up the drivethrough (towards the speaker, not the exit??) giggling and drinking her water. she yelled ""thank you!"" at the speaker and walked away.

i still don't know how to feel about it to be honest. everyone else at work has seemingly just accepted it but i'm just like.. why do we let her get away with this? i feel like at the very least someone should call someone for her cause i feel like with the way she's acting she needs help, genuinely.",crazy customer

289,DunkinDonuts,they can really take the quality of their drinks to the next level if they did so. i know starbucks has one in all their stores. and you usually see the workers making videos online doing so. i just had that thought yesterday because i've been buying matchas more often. and i really have to shake the hell out the drink to get it mixed. i mean it still doesn't do much. but it also just made me want to invest in buying my own matcha with the whisk and bowl. it's really not worth paying $5 for a half ass drink lol. might just go back to buying an iced chai daiky instead.,why doesn't dunkin invest in a blender for their stores?
290,DunkinDonuts,i told the worker many times it's just milk and expresso but she wasn't listening. and she was the one getting frustrated saying 'i make cappuccinos every day.' *sigh*,i've been denied a iced cappuccino because there was no frozen coffee syrup.
291,DunkinDonuts,"so went to my local dunkin' on monday, had an offer for a free drink from points. i got a macchiato with brown sugar and caramel syrup.  picked it up, got it home, started drinking it and it had neither caramel nor brown sugar syrup in it.   i called the store and they were very nice and took my name and said ""no problem we can remake it for you.""  however, i think i'd rather get a drink that i have had before that i know i will enjoy. is that being greedy? or is that acceptable?  was going to head over shortly. thanks!!",can you get a remake with another drink?
292,DunkinDonuts,"purely curious, but all of the dunkins in my area have a sign on the drive-thru window that says ""if asked to pay a different amount, please contact the manager."" some of them work, some don't, but i've never seen them at any other drive-thrus.

294,DunkinDonuts,"our store manager hardly buys anything on truck, causing basic items to be out almost everyday (swirl, espresso, cold brew grounds, ice cream for our br side). night crew is in need of new members since he only schedules a two man shift each night. this is horrible since the store is one of the busiest in our area. the franchise owner has already talked to him about this issue but he just lies and tells him everything is fine. on top of that, our oasis machine has been clogged for weeks and he never put a work order in until now. that‚Äôs just a summary of it all. i‚Äôd like to hear your guys stories though.",does anyone else have a bad manager?
295,DunkinDonuts,"you're not gonna believe this, but it's tomato, pesto, and cheese. 

a customer asked me this a few weeks ago and i almost lost my mind. 

someone asked me yesterday, but his girlfriend was like 
""what do you mean what comes on it? it's in the name"". and she's my new best friend.","""what comes on the tomato pesto grilled cheese"""
296,DunkinDonuts,"let me start a list of some of the most weird shit / dumbest shit customers say:

\- they order 'well done hash browns' as if it's a steak or something. i actually laughed when someone ordered and asked them what they meant, dude says, just put the hash browns in the oven for 2 rotations. i highly doubt that's what he really wanted.  

\- ""let me get a small black iced coffee with 2 shots of x, 2 sugar, and some caramel"" 

\- i had a guy order a black hot coffee with 3 creams, no sugar. gave it to him, he complained it had 3 creams. same guy proceeds to order again, 2 frozen medium coffees. give him the first one, buddy loses it and screams that he wanted a small. i told him ok i'll give him a small even though he paid for mediums. 

\- i had someone order 3 sandwhiches, then goes to wait, next person ordered a small coffee and a glaze stick. i give him it. first customer comes over and starts getting in my face about someone else getting served first. i said he didn't order hot food, the customer goes ""well he has the same bag"", i was actually dumbfounded at how stupid you gotta be to say that and think that that is how things work.

\- people really think as i'm making someone's coffee they can order by yelling at me their order. i usually just ignore these tards.

\- people that wait in line and come up to you and go ""i ordered on the app"", like okay.

\- people that come in complain we don't have their mobile order and then i look at their app and tell them they ordered to a different dunkins. very satisfying especially when they're all worked up over 'our' error. 

\- had a guy scream at me for a blueberry donut, i said i'm too new here to understand where they might be and he points to the cornbread donuts and asks for that one. not sure if he was happy with the result.

\- had another guy scream at me after i asked him to confirm he wanted 2 coconut donuts.

\- had a crazy ass lady that spent her whole day sitting in the dunks ask for the dragonfruit refresher in a cup and ask if it would be free. like, what.

\- have multiple idiots that think the tip jar is a 'take a penny' type deal. it's not.

\- people who don't move out of the way after they order when there is a line.

\- had a dude scream at me ""when am i gonna get my coffee i been waitin here for 5 minutes"" during a rush. we are 2 people working, ive been there at that point a week probably.

\- had another dude get his croissant wrong it was chocolate not plain and he lost his mind and walked out yelling fuck this instead of waiting for a plain one to be heated, literally does not take even a minute. 

\- people that are rude / yell at you then come back in and pretend it never happened, naw ur service is gonna be slow as hell and i'm going to be rude back to you. 

\- some of these peoples coffee orders are legitimately disgusting and sometimes half the cup is full of flavoring shit, like u see the posts on here all the time about nasty coffee orders, it's true and a good chunk of the time it's ordered on ubereats/grubhub/doordash.

\- people talk to you like ur a computer, i understand the hey how's it going , may be a bit annoying but if u walk up to me and just go ""medium hot coffee black"" im gonna be a little annoyed , 99% of the time these people are boomers.",been working here 3 weeks now : i believe 85% of customers are idiots
297,DunkinDonuts,"my coffee was made wrong. no cream in iced vanilla, which i definitely ordered. i asked if it was mine. dd person said yes. i stated i ordered it light. so what does she do next? literally takes the cover off as she throws the coffee at me. right an my broken foot. now i have to live with a cast that reeks of coffee. did she apologize or show anything but disdain for me? nope. i left, leaving the 2 coffees behind. why is this acceptable behavior? never again will i set foot in a dunkin‚Äôs.",then this happened‚Ä¶

300,DunkinDonuts,"hey folks, i work morning shifts (usually 6am). would munchkins or donuts be made yet? i don't know when dunking workers start preparing donuts and have social anxiety in person and on the phone so this is my next best shot.

301,DunkinDonuts,"so this morning i ordered my usual cold brew and strawberry donut. i usually eat my donut on my ride to work. i pulled off, got a couple minutes away, open my bag, and found a small dead bug on my donut. i‚Äôm already running late for work at this point so i didn‚Äôt turn around. instead, i sent a lovely email with pictures to the customer service email and got back ‚Äúwe requested the store representative follow up with you. we‚Äôre sorry this restaurant let you down. we hope you‚Äôll give dunkin another chance again soon‚Äù.

i never included the address of the store however it was provided in the response  email from them, meaning they pulled up my account based on my email. they can see i go to dunkin literally everyday. 

i see a lot of posts on this sub of people complaining about the smallest things and getting points towards a free coffee. i didn‚Äôt get any thing. granted, i was told someone would follow up so something may come of that, but how likely is this?",how likely is a store representative to follow up?

305,DunkinDonuts,"i know there are already threads about this but i'm hoping the more we all freak out about it, the more corporate eyes see it and maybe, just maybe bring it back.  


i am absoluetely devastated over this. i'm 33 and have been ordering this drink since i was a teenager. it was definitely a comfort drink i got for special occasions or whenever i was traveling since i'm not an every day dunks person. i don't drink coffee and only make tea at home because buying it at dunks is silly to me, so this drink just made me so happy. a way to my heart. 

&amp;#x200b;

the chai latte and vanilla chai laette is shit in comparison. i've managed to find one place locally and one in new hampshire that still has the powder left over and made me one. i tried buying the powder yesterday in nh and they wouldn't let me. 

&amp;#x200b;

can anyone tell me how it's made? i'm friends with a mobile coffee shop owner who says she makes a similar drink and i would love to try and get it replicated. i cannot remember what kind of milk it's made with though? also, and this seems like a dumb question, but is it black tea or chai tea? recipes i've found online in the past have said black tea. i know other ingredients in the powder include cinnamon, nutmeg, and a crap ton of sugar.",dunkin has officially discontinued the vanilla spice (formally vanilla chai) and i can no longer sustain life on this planet
306,DunkinDonuts,"here are some things i‚Äôve noticed that bug workers and customers alike 

1) if you are ordering a dozen donuts and you want to pick them out dear god do not do it through the drive thru. come in. also donuts typically sell out by 1pm so if you come at 5 and ask for a dozen you will probably be let down.

2) if you want cream or sugar please say that. if you want a specific amount, tell the person. so many times people assume the employees just know their order and know how they take their coffee and then get mad when it doesn‚Äôt come out the way they wanted. also- we don‚Äôt mind re making drinks at all.

3) if you say you want a medium black coffee with caramel in it- then it‚Äôs no longer a black coffee because the swirls have milk built in. 

4) if you place your mobile order a minute before you come it won‚Äôt be ready. and if you place it and come thru an hour later everything will be melted. my best advice is to place it before leaving your house so it will be ready when you come.

5) if you have two separate orders please tell the person at the window instead of just starting at them and not leaving the drive thru. sometimes it‚Äôs so busy the order taker doesn‚Äôt have time to notify the cashier that someone has two separate orders and people will just sit in their cars looking into space for 5 minutes instead of telling you they had a second order. 

6) if you pay in all change i will personally take 10 minutes to count it and hand your food out, i get if it was a $2 bill but if you give me $8 worth of dimes and nickels and are rude about it (most times) then i will take my sweet old time doing it. 

7) most important- we are just people like you we are just doing our jobs and it‚Äôs just coffee. if it is wrong, ask nicely and it will be remade. so many people treat food workers as personal servants and get mad when they aren‚Äôt catered to during a rush where everyone is doing 5 things at once. be patient and nice and appreciate that it‚Äôs just coffee and mess ups can be fixed :) i can tell you that the regular customers we are rude are very well known and all the employees know who is rude and who isn‚Äôt before they even come up to the window. and the regular customers who are sweet bulls relationships and we are happy to see them!",tips for customers

310,DunkinDonuts,"i ordered my usual cold brew yesterday, and i saw the brown sugar cinnamon flavor swirl and thought i'd try it. there was a glitch in my app and it reverted to flavor combination i had changed my mind about, so i ended up getting 2 bsc and 2 french vanilla with my usual cream and sugar mix. 
it was awful! there was absolutely no flavor swirls to be found, not even vanilla. i hate being that customer that goes back in ""eew my drink isn't right!!"" so i just dumped it out after a few sips. 5 bucks literally poured out on the concrete.

316,DunkinDonuts,"share your worst dunkin experiences either as a worker or customer. i‚Äôll go first! 

i went to dunks last week and had the worst experience. i have never complained but i wish i had in this case. 
pulled into the drive thru, dunks was empty. sat at the mic for 12 minutes until someone finally spoke up. teens were laughing and goofing off, but i really just needed a coffee so i stayed. ordered a small black iced coffee with sugar and avocado toast. 
pulled to the window and couldn‚Äôt see anyone in there. sat around for 10 minutes before i almost left and finally a woman came by. she looked cooked out of her mind and asked me again what i had ordered. i repeated my order twice to her and she repeated it back to me and charged me. she then handed me a medium hot coffee with xx, and i swear someone had already drank from it because there was pink lipgloss on the cap‚Ä¶ 
annoyed i just explained my order again and she apologized. 
i see her goofing off with some guy through the window, and i waited for another 10 minutes. i got so annoyed i knocked on the window. pissed this time i just kindly asked for my coffee and food. she then handed me a wet bag and a small iced coffee with some type of swirl in it. i wound up leaving rather then complaining. 
got home and the avocado toast wasn‚Äôt out in the regular box, it was wrapped in a napkin, soggy wet, with brown avocado spread‚Ä¶ 
i wish i had the courage to complain, but honestly the employees gave me such an off putting vibe i didn‚Äôt want to put up with them. i‚Äôm debating writing in anonymously to the manager because now that i have shared my experiences my siblings and friends also had bad experiences with those two as well. my dad even pointed out that the guy doesn‚Äôt even work there, or just is never in uniform. and the woman often had her kids back there with her.

351,DunkinDonuts,just because it won't be over the top busy like a morning coffee shift. shouldn't mean you have one person handling all the work load. i go in as a customer as various different locations in nyc and i see this all the time. and the crazy thing is most these locations still be very busy late into the night. i was ordering a drink yesterday and there was like two people ahead of me. then all of sudden by the time i ordered there was 3 people behind me. and i'm like damn there should at least have someone working the register at night while the other handles the drinks. it's kind of also not that safe to have one person work a night shift alone. idk just a random thought i had after i seen dude juggle all those orders last night.,it's so messed up how dunkin has only one person working overnight shifts at most locations
352,DunkinDonuts,so i recently decided to go and try different coffees. i just realized recently the butter pecan was the syrup not the actual coffee itself. go figure. anyway i look it up and saw it‚Äôs over 60+ for the syrup from dunks brand itself. i saw that torani makes butter pecan syrup as well. i like what they make and often can find them in tj max. does anyone know if it taste like the dunks one. like it does not have to be the exact but enough that it will leave me happy. my dunks sometimes makes my coffee right.,butter pecan.

354,DunkinDonuts,"i have seen many people complaining how their cold brew had only brown sugar foam and no syrup in there. and i know exactly what is happening lol. 

dunkin menu (check the app) has two varieties of these drinks:

1) brown sugar cream cold brew: this drink comes with brown sugar foam as well as brown sugar syrup. 

2) cold brew with brown sugar cold foam: this drink is only cold brew with foam on top and no syrup by default. 

if you go in app --&gt; order --&gt; crafted cold brew, you'll see both these options. 

now what is happening is either you're ordering number 2 above expecting number 1 or the person taking order is confusing between the two. but both options exist on the menu. 

solution: spell it out lol. whatever way you are ordering, in app or drive through, let them know you want x number of pumps of syrup and brown sugar cold foam on top. easy peasy :)

i had a really weird experience happen today and wanted to share with you guys. today i got a cookies and cream milkshake, and the workers took a really long time. i did not mind as i wasn‚Äôt in a hurry, and there were no other cars infront of me or behind me. when i received my drink, it was very watery and not at all like the previous milkshakes i have had. i did not want to be a ‚Äúkaren‚Äù so i drove off and took a sip, but it had no flavor and was definitely not like any of the previous milkshakes i have had. due to this, i decided to turn around and take it back to the store to ask if he could maybe remake it. i was really nice and asked him if he could remake it, and the worker replied with ‚Äúthe drink is perfectly fine, if i remake it it‚Äôs just going to be the same way, so idk what to tell you.‚Äù i was perplexed, i have never received a response like this at any establishment, so i just asked for a refund. the worker then said i don‚Äôt know how to do refunds so just come back another day. 

this was such an odd experience, and the dunkin donuts i went to has had some recent problems, with many of my friends complaining that since they switch employees so often, the employees are new and sometimes mess up the drinks. this is totally fine, and was my initial expectation, that maybe he was a new employee. but saying that you will not remake the drink because you made it right is such an odd way to reply to such a request. i wanted to share in this sub because i love dunkin and this has never happened before, and to be honest made me quite sad.",employees being rude to customers

i ask because i've noticed if i order ""1 cane syrup,"" it always is sweeter than when i order 2. i believe the app represents 1 shot by removing the quantity altogether, which i suspect most employees read as ""they want the normal amount of cane syrup,"" which is 3 shots.

i'm interested in how they train u guys cuz at starbys they're so strict on amounts. like we have to fill ingredients up to certain lines on the cup, shake drinks a certain amount of times. for our brown sugar oatmilk shaken espresso we have to shake the cinnamon bottle twice. for lattes/cappuccinos we have to steam the milk for a certain amount of time. we even have set patterns for how we have to drizzle caramel on the sides of cups + on top of drinks.

it just feels like i'm paying over $6 for mostly ice. i know there's an option for ""less ice"" if you order ahead but i've been afraid for a macchiato either they won't fill the cup then, or it will throw off the ratio of milk/espresso. any insight if it's supposed to be made with that much ice or not? should i be trying that ""less ice"" option? i also count calories and don't want to throw it way off if i end up requesting less ice and just getting more milk- but then i wonder if the little liquid i'm actually getting in the drink is *really* 380 calories if the cup is mostly ice.",how much ice is there supposed to be?

441,DunkinDonuts,"hiya. 
some info- i live in a small town in new england. dunkins quite popular. husband works at various job sites and frequents a dunkin location 2-3 times a week, goes to other locations the other days. 
i place his mobile orders for him through the app every time he needs it which is often. 
i am placing these orders 10-15 minutes before he arrives at the locations. why? because the food part of the order is only ready half of the time. so we figure give them lots of extra time to have it done. but it happened again this morning. i placed the order at 6:45am, husband walked in at 7am. drink is ready, food isnt. 
weve never been offered refunds, never even really complained to the workers because we arent the confrontational kind. at this point im just irritated for my husband. he doesnt have time to get in line and wait after finding out his food isnt ready for 10 mins. hence why we use mobile ordering in the first place. so he can walk in, get his stuff, walk out. for months they just...never gave him the donuts he ordered. now its whatever food he gets. the drinks the only thing present. 
i wish i had a record of how often this happens. it sounds ridiculous but we've been doing this for over a year, and i want to say at least 30-40% of the time he walks out without breakfast and is upset, to say the least. 
i called customer support this morning.. guy says he will bring this up to the specific stores owners/managers and have them call me. not looking forward to that as its a small town where everybody knows everybody.. this has the potential to get uncomfortable. but we are pretty fed up after so many repeats of this.","mobile orders only ever half ready, really irked."

447,DunkinDonuts,i was just thinking about this when i was making food. we use black trays that are reusable so when we make bacon the fat spills over the sheet we use to cook on. wiping them down still leaves some bacon fat. eggs and hash browns for example can pass the protection sheet and touch the bacon grease if not cleaned properly busy days were just inna hurry so deep cleaning them isn't done untill closing. but dam we go through alot of bacon lol.,i wouldn't get food if you can't have pork.

457,DunkinDonuts,"hey everyone, i just became an overnight baker a few weeks ago under the assumption that most of my shift would be overnight, but it's not. i come in at 1:30 to prep for store opening at 4:30 which includes making the coffee, baking the frozen croissants, bagels, and muffins, putting the shipments of donuts up etc. and once the store opens, i switch to opener and work till 10 am upfront. the owner is teaching me but she is very pedantic and always stresses me for time even though i just started. i also have to remember all the things as a baker and upfront which i didn't sign up for, and thought i would have no customer interaction. i asked if we could start earlier but she said no because the goods wouldn't be fresh by opening. i also asked if there were any other hours i could work, but also said no. my coworkers said overnight is the least desired role due to the excessive nature of the position and the particular nature of the owner. i am also a bad multitasker so the myriad tasks i have to get done in 3 hours is sort of overwhelming for me. i tried to stick it out for 3 weeks, but it doesn't feel like it's getting any better. are all of the overnight positions like this at other dunkin's? i would like to know others thoughts and if i should suck it up.","just became an overnight baker, did i get tricked?"
458,DunkinDonuts,"okay, so this has been bugging me for the past few hours ever since i ended my shift today at work. so, i work at the local dunkin's in my town and the day was mostly good. one of my better workdays even. i'm new and have only been there for a month and a half by now. today, during one of the last hours of my shift, i was trying to fix the donut case. it was almost noon and there were two empty spaces at the top that i wanted to fill with two single trays of donuts that were at the bottom so i could cover the last shelf with the blinds once it was empty. 

this girl who i just met last week starts coming over while i am thinking about putting them next to the big trays of donuts and is like ""you probably can just leave the space empty because i'm going to move the muffins over there."" now the muffins are perfectly placed at the top and usually sitting there in the other case because they're supposed to be. not to mention there is a full single tray of each muffin next to each other. the second case was looking nice. there were cases with single donuts, and i would gladly move them to a different tray that has space, but sometimes the manager tells me to leave them in their own tray, so we don't confuse the customers. plus there were plenty of donuts in other trays, and spaces between the trays at the top that needed to be filled and they would perfectly be there, if i just placed some in the middle at the top and fill any empty spaces with some donut trays at the bottom, like my supervisor usually tells me to do. 

i don't know if this girl is returning employee or new, she might have been the former, but i was a little confused when she told me that she was going to transfer the muffins there. i mean, i've seen other co-workers just do what i was initially going to do. when i told her what i was about to do, she was like ""i'm just telling you this because i'm closing and am going to put the muffins over on this case instead"". i told her i was just putting some on there for now so there wouldn't be empty gaps because i know our boss doesn't like that, and i placed a tray of boston kreme at the top to fill a gap. she just said ""okay, you can do that for now,"" but then i saw her walk over to two of our other co-workers who were just standing there by drive-thru looking at us, and she looks like she was saying something to them, and then the other co-worker she was talking to said ""yeah, that's how everyone else feels,"" while she was looking right at me. and i was like ""are they talking about me?"" 

like, what does ""everyone \[supposedly\] feel""? because i wasn't trying to be a jerk or know-it-all. i know i'm new i was just trying to follow what i was usually told, especially since i had tried to put different pastries on certain trays and told to ""keep some in their own trays instead and focus on filling the gaps"". plus, i still had chores to finish before my shift ends and fixing the donut case is one of them, so i didn't want to just stand there and do nothing. i immediately asked  the other two co-workers if i had made a mistake and explained what i was trying to do. they told me  that they might move stuff over soon, so i was like ""okay"". 

i then told the girl that i'm just ""leaving some trays up there to fill in the gaps for now"" because i didn't want to leave the case looking incomplete like that. then she was like ""okay, it's just that i have a certain way of doing things when organizing the cases."" and i was like ""okay, i understand."" i was like, 'alright, i'll leave it to her. she probably is just a returning employee and have done this many times already. it's whatever. my only issue is that fact that it seems like she was talking about me or what i was doing to the other co-workers and one of them was making a passive-aggressive comment while looking in my direction. i didn't know exactly what the girl whispered to her, but with what she did immediately after what i said i was trying to do, it seems like this is what happened. 

you could easily guess what the subject of their mini-chat was about at that point. and i'm thinking ""okay. i'm not trying to step on anyone's toes. i'm just trying to do my job. if this girl has something to say, she can say it to my face instead of being a fake b\*tch and trying to say something behind my back as if i wouldn't notice. as for the other co-worker, she's said some mild condescending shit before (did on my second day of work, if you remember my post about that), but she's usually upfront with me on some stuff if i've made a mistake. i don't need that passive-aggressive nonsense just because i wanted to just fill the remaining gaps on a donut case. you know? like, i don't have time for that toxic bs. it's rude and petty. like, if i was making a mistake here by not letting her do it before my shift ends or something, my bad, but it does not warrant that behavior. not to mention the fact that they seemed a bit standoffish when i was clocking out for work annoyed me, too. like, it's not that deep. have any of you ever dealt with something like this months within your start at dunkin' donuts?",i'm wondering if my co-workers were talking shit because of something small i did at work.

i have heard say that the reason it lasted only so long was because it wasn't aimed at plant based people. it was one of those ""veg* products mainly aimed at health conscious omnivore"". it was vegetarian but not vegan. if it has used no eggs and non-dairy cheese or even no cheese, maybe it would have sold better.... *maybe*?

today i went to my usual location, ordered the same thing, and it looked normal with a big chunk of espresso on top. when they ask if i want an ""extra shot of espresso"" are they asking if i want the extra that macchiatos are supposed to come with (compared to lattes)? is this a thing at some locations? i remember the same thing happening when i happened to be at dunkin on the other side of town- when i ordered a macchiato they asked if i wanted an extra shot. just wondering in case i want to order a macchiato from that location again- do i need to say yes to the extra shot to get the ""normal"" recipe?",extra shot for macchiatos

i got to work at around 3:25pm after having a panic attack over missing part of my uniform and overall having a bad day and being late. i clock in, put my stuff away and go to the front. 

there‚Äôs a lady standing at the donut racks looking irritated, she looked at me and and said ‚Äúwe‚Äôll are you going to help me?‚Äù and i politely said ‚Äúsure if you come over to the cash register i can get your order started‚Äù 

she comes over and starts her order, 18 munchkins and 2 custard filled donuts. after confirming with my co worker, i tell her we don‚Äôt have any more. she immediately cops an attitude, saying how ridiculous it is we don‚Äôt have donuts. i just kind of sit there until she decided on a new donut, she wanted bismarck, again, we‚Äôre out of that. at that point she throws her hands down and says ‚Äúfine i don‚Äôt want any of it. i want a refund.‚Äù so i put the munchkins and donuts away. 

i‚Äôve never done a refund before, ever, so i try to ask one of the older girls, who tells me to text the manager. i text the manger who, is no help. so i figure it out myself after sitting there for 20 mins trying to figure it out, about half way through she asked to speak to a manager and my manager wasn‚Äôt there and she responded with ‚Äúso they‚Äôre having people who are useless and worthless at their job working with out a manager? wow‚Äù at this point im trying not to cry, im shaking violently, i haven‚Äôt eaten or drank at all at this point, im tired and not having a good day. 

i sit there and i don‚Äôt say anything and i figure it out and accidentally refunded for 14 munchkins and the two donuts instead of 18 munchkins so literally $1.05 was missing. she, once again, called me useless at my job and she wanted the managers number who was ignoring me now. she was yelling at me and i genuinely thought it was the system because i double checked and thought everything was okay, luckily at this point my managers boss came in and helped her, the lady switched her attitude with her and wasn‚Äôt rude at all while i was sitting there trying not to break down sobbing in the middle of the lobby. 

once my managers boss left i immediately went to the freezer and sobbed for a good 5 minutes. luckily i had awesome customers the rest of the day :)

we actually give him like 7 sugars because he always bitches that we never give him sugar. like dude we give more than twice the amount you ask. 

and he bitches about us wearing masks every single time. ‚Äúyou know masks do nothing‚Äù ‚Äúthe government is lying to you about the masks‚Äù

i genuinely think i hate this dude and, this is gonna sound bad but hear me out, ive started purposely doing stuff to try and make him never come back. sometimes (every time) i give him decaf. i drop my customer service nice voice. i wont make small talk. sometimes i put 10 sugars. ive started staring at him as wide eyed as i can and completely unblinking when he gets to the window to freak him out. 


i know its bad and honestly i dont care because he deserves it. my only interaction with this man is him telling me i cant do my job right so im gonna do anything i can to make him stop coming back. 


if we truly fuck it up every single day. if we are truly that incompetent. why would you still come here. why not ask for extra sugar on the side. why.

617,DunkinDonuts,she came through the drive through a while after she left and asked for a refund because her avocado toast was 'untoasted and horrible'. so i said alright cool so give me the other avocado toast so i could throw it away for you and she got flustered and refused because she 'already ate it'. so i refused a refund because if you've already kept the product then you spent the money. she gave attitude and of course treated me like a dog that wasn't listening to her so i just told her to have a great day and shut the drive through door. she didn't come back. we have problems with people asking for refunds or remakes especially with food and it's the same set of people every time for the same reasons just taking advantage of the system. anyone else experienced stuff like this?,didn't give crazy old lady a refund. was i wrong?

i hate seeing articles like this because it really just shows that people don't understand how menus work. you can get any flavor in a coffee. a caramel cold brew is not a different menu item from a normal cold brew. that's why they separate the flavors from the drinks on the menu.

what makes it even worse is stuff like the final entry ""caramel cold foam cold brew,"" where they say they don't know if it's the same caramel that goes in the foam as that which goes in the drink. like, no, the foam comes from a can and the caramel swirl is a syrup.

dunkin' to me prides itself on simplicity that allows you to customize your drink how you want without being pretentious with their menu. so it annoys me when articles and people tackle it with the same mentality as they do starbucks.",article dumbness

as for the cornbread donut, i couldn't finish it. it was the consistency of the sour cream donut (which is what i usually get) with gritty corn meal. it also had a preservative-y fake sugar taste. very weird mouth feel. i will not get that again.

however, when i mobile order, the label does not come out with the ‚Äú1‚Äù but rather it just says ‚Äú____ swirl‚Äù without any numbers in front. my question: as an employee, when you see this order come up for a mobile, do you know to only put one swirl?? sometimes it tastes like there‚Äôs way more than just one. i‚Äôd love to know!! thanks!!",1 pump of swirl

640,DunkinDonuts,"oh boy what an absolute shit show this was. i went to the dunkin closest to my gym after a workout. and this location is always hit or miss so i should have known better.

i ordered a ""medium iced cake batter latte with whole milk""

they gave me a medium iced *coffee* (cake batter) with oat milk. okay no problem, people make mistakes. another barista remade it.

except this time she put a large iced cake batter signature latte on the counter. i asked whose it was. i thought maybe someone else ordered a cake batter signature latte *because i sure as hell didn't*. the barista said, ""this is what you ordered"". i said no i didn't. 

she upgraded me to a large signature because of their earlier mistake, which is my guess. which is fine. but i don't want a 700-million calorie bomb with the whipped cream nasty mocha drizzle sprinkle bullshit on top. ugh. i just wanted a basic bitch iced latte with 3 cake batter swirls. why is that so hard? 

anyway, i didn't ask them to remake it, said thank you and walked away. i think if you're going to upgrade someone's drink, ask them first: ""would you like me to upgrade your drink to a large signature as a courtesy?"" 

taste test: initial sip i get a massive sugar alcohol taste. it reminds me of old-school starbucks french vanilla frappuccino's. i honestly don't taste cake batter. just tastes like heavy french vanilla+alcohol. it's not the worst swirl i've tried. but i can't say that i am a fan. i definitely prefer the butter pecan now that i've tried both. with butter pecan i can still taste the espresso. whereas with this one i don't taste coffee at all. it just tastes like sugar alcohol. so yeah, looks like this is a dud for me and i probably won't buy it again. #bringbacksaltedcaramel",my review of the cake batter signature latte

thoughts?",free!! but not really.
665,DunkinDonuts,"this is based off how my stores machines operate. 

for 2% milk and skim, request specifically 3-5 milk. specify a number. if you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôll just say ‚Äúmilk‚Äù and most employees will use the lowest setting unless a number is specified. these milks (and cream) get dispensed from a machine. 

for dairy, almond, or coconut - at my store we literally eye these unless it‚Äôs a latte or macchiato. i would ask for the cup 1/4, 1/3, or 1/2 filled with milk. pls don‚Äôt take too much advantage of this and try to shortcut a latte. lattes are made with espresso so it will not be the same no matter how much milk you put in. 

if you‚Äôre dining in, ask the front counter person to communicate that w/the staff cuz i don‚Äôt think the pos has a way to note that. and if you just say ‚Äú3 almond/oat/coconut‚Äù some stores are eyeballing it and are more bound to mess it up.

i'm actually overqualified to work here, but i want to work here because i don't have enough self esteem to work at the type of job i studied for and i don't want to sit in an office all day right now.

nothing wrong with working at dunkin, i eat here every day! 

i worked here for a month in 2018 at a different location and the management was horrible. 

she hid in the utility closet aka her ""office"" her whole shift and never trained me! 

just threw me right in! it was bad. when i switched to night shift, the woman working with me bullied me into quitting because she preferred working alone to keep the whole 10 dollars in tips she made. 

my current manager has been working at dd since 2000 and interviewed me for 45 mins. she told me this location used to be really rough and the old owner ""left""  and a whole new crew came in including her. 

i then went and trained at another location to watch du videos with a very nice hr lady. everything seems to be going well but i'm worried about moving too slow or making too many mistakes or getting yelled at by massholes. normal people can handle this but cue ptsd and high functioning autism. 

i think maybe a lot of people who work food service, could be similar to me. how do you handle it? i used to be a waitress for years and i honestly don't remember how i did it. sorry if this is really long!!!

702,DunkinDonuts,"hello, i am a dunkin employee, and during the pre-february window, i made a little post where i went through each of the new items before they were widely known, and i missed the valentines/march one, so i guess i'll do it now. since there's only three new items, (somehow, lemonade is already on backorder... geez.) i'll also give some personal drink recommendations and a weird story.

&amp;#x200b;

cake batter swirl (in a small iced coffee, cream only): okay, this is the one i was looking forward to the most. i love cake batter flavored things, and this was pretty great. for some reason, when pumping it it comes out thin so ask for a little extra. it's sweet, but when trying to mix swirls together it gets muddied up by the other flavors. 8/10

butter pecan (in a small iced coffee, cream only): when i got hired last september, we still had some and god, there is definitely a reason why everyone loves it. it's sweet, nutty, everything great. i don't care if the ice cream market looks at it as a geezer flavor, it's a 10/10!

mango pineapple refresher (sample cup of pure concentrate): okay not gonna lie, it's underwhelming. it just tastes pineappley with not much other substance to it. my mistake for doing that. 4/10 

mango pineapple refresher (green tea): the green tea brings something out of it at least, giving it some depth besides fruitiness. 6/10.

mango pineapple refresher (coconutmilk): i'm sorry, but if i'm going to try this, i need an ambulance crew on standby. a little coconut is fine, but having a drink being half-coconut milk would probably kill me

&amp;#x200b;

now we're in the weird stuff

strawberry shortcake 2.0: ask for a vanilla bean coolata with 2 pumps strawbery and a non-cautious amount of cake batter. if you thought the vanilla bean + strawberry on it's own was great, try that.

""illegal"" lemonade refreshers: if your dunkin has bottled lemonade, ask for any of the refreshers with just concentrate and room in the cup. put the lemonade in. this has been my go to drink for the past few weeks.

butter pecan hot chocolate: as simple as it says. butter pecan swirl, hot chocolate. good stuff, even despite the tummy trouble because coconut oil in the hot choc

plain yeast donut: so... our baker called out 2 days ago so we had way too much stock. out of curiosity, i bit into one of the plain, unfrosted yeast rings and... eugh! it's floury and salty with nothing really redeeming to it. it's like scraping the underside of 20 english muffins and not toasting them. if you see that hollow excuse of something out as a baker's choice, avoid it!",i tried the new available flavors so you don't have to (again!)

735,DunkinDonuts,"i know this has been asked before, but i'm having difficultly finding an exact answer. some articles say it's a tablespoon, some articles a teaspoon. most articles say a small gets 2 cream, medium 3 cream, large 4 cream, etc. what they don't say is how much (in tablespoons, teaspoons, or milliliters) is 1 cream, exactly? 

i know they use light cream (not half n' half), but 3 tablespoons of light cream for a medium does sound like a lot of cream for 14oz of coffee. that coffee is creamy though :)

738,DunkinDonuts,"i just want to order an iced mocha with coconut milk. sometimes i get mocha latte, sometimes it‚Äôs a brewed coffee with mocha in it, sometimes it‚Äôs an iced coffee. today, it was a large iced coffee with 4 mocha and 4 sugar packets (the sugar i did not ask for‚Ä¶). is this standard? i work at starbucks, so i just assume a mocha (as in a latte with mocha in it) is called the same everywhere. i‚Äôve tried saying cafe mocha or iced latte with mocha in it, but it always seems to come back with some addition i didn‚Äôt ask for. no big deal about the sugar added today because it tastes alright, but it wasn‚Äôt even mixed so it‚Äôs like just granulated sugar sitting at the bottom of my cup t-t 
working at starbucks is really taxing, so i imagine dunkin is the same, and i do not mean to belittle the workers in anyway especially if i am ordering wrong. can anyone help me out in correcting my order, or is this just a misinterpretation of employees?",am i ordering this wrong??

743,DunkinDonuts,"i wanted a medium salted caramel cold foam cold brew. after the employee put the ice and poured the cold brew into the medium cup, i asked her to pour that into a large cup and then fill it to the top with cold foam.

she said that it‚Äôs supposed to be an extra charge because i‚Äôm getting more cold foam, but she‚Äôd do it for me just this one time. is this true? other employees in this same store and other stores have been doing this for me with no problem, and no extra charge.

744,DunkinDonuts,"so there‚Äôs a longer story behind this, but for a synopsis, i‚Äôm wondering if they‚Äôre still a thing, specifically in south carolina. a friend of mine was raving the other day about them, and i‚Äôd never even heard of them, so i said the next time i saw him, we‚Äôd have to get one. he then said they said they didn‚Äôt have them the last time he tried to order one, so i guess my question is: is it supply shortages or discontinued? and if it‚Äôs discontinued, what exactly was it, so i can make it at home?

748,DunkinDonuts,"i had one of the most degrading and disrepectful experiences i have ever had at a dunkin in the nashville area.  this was not, by any means, the first time, i had been treated badly or left unhappy with the poor service, but this time, it was so bad, i neither got the manager i wanted to speak to when i was coldly told i had an attitude, and i was told to leave without getting part of the order i had already paid for.

in my frustration, i sent an email to dunkin customer relations, relaying the experience, the complete lack of customer service, and the fact that they didn't even try to provide a substitute, but just told me to leave.

i got back a boilerplate email response, telling me that my experience had gone to the franchisee, and i was refunded the total of the item i had been denied.

considering the absolutely horrendous experience i had, i am not putting up with such a canned response.  after multiple terrible experiences, and now getting such an uncaring and shallow response, it's time to forget about the loyalty program, and just grab a coffee or doughnut where i think might work.  7-eleven has them, kroger has a doughnut bakery.  we have thornton's in the area.  krispy kremes are around.  i am not going to throw my money at a company that gives me such a bad experience every few months.

771,DunkinDonuts,i‚Äôm just curious what dunkins policy is when it comes to the employees putting on the butter or cream cheese on bagels and muffins. it‚Äôs super inconsistent on which places will do it for you and which places won‚Äôt. literally on the menu there are two options for butter/cc which say on the food itself or on the side. but some stores will refuse to put the butter/cc on themselves and force the customer to do it which makes no sense because if i‚Äôm coming through a drive through asking for a muffin heated with butter why would i want to put it on myself? especially with a crappy plastic knife while i‚Äôm driving? so does it just come down to the laziness of the employee or do certain locations not allow their employees to put it on themselves? for example my girlfriend just got a muffin heated with butter and they told her they only put the butter on the side. even though it‚Äôs on the menu that you can order with butter on it. so i‚Äôm convinced since some places do it and some don‚Äôt it‚Äôs just laziness but wanted to know whether there was some sort of local franchise policy forbidding it.,putting butter/cream cheese on bagels/muffins

776,DunkinDonuts,"tl/dr: i'm an overwhelmed employee who used to really enjoy my job but now my work is draining me more and more and i feel torn. 

i'm getting to that point where i want to quit for real this time. i'm the main baker, and during the golden age of my employment as i call it (last spring/early summer) i really loved my job. i made a lot of friends and work didn't feel like work. 

but in the fall of last year, things got pretty blah and now things are just getting bad. we got bought out by a big company and they're making so many changes, like the dress code. we're even changing how the donut case is organized and specific kinds of donuts go into assorted dozens now, which led to us running out of blueberry at like 7am. and i love the way i organized my donuts and i don't want to be told what to do in the one thing where i felt like i had creative freedom... corporate obviously doesn't listen to what we feel is best and what works for our individual store. 

worst part, there's literally so much drama lately! i almost walked out today because my coworkers are like going at each other's throats. i'm going to feel bad if i end up leaving because i know how hard it is to find a baker. but this place has been sucking the life out of me for the past year and a half overall and i can't anymore. this isn't even to mention how the customers in the town that i work can be so mean and racist as well. we've had sandwiches thrown at us, direct threats, and some people have used terrible derogatory terms that i won't repeat here. all have been banned by our store, but similar people eventually take their place. the kind people get fewer and far between no matter how nice i am to them. all of it makes me dread coming in to work. 

i miss our old manager, but our newer manager is awesome and i know he's trying his best and he's doing well. i don't want to let him down. but i just can't do the drama anymore or the early mornings or people yelling at me. it's getting real bad for my mental health. i would be sad to leave but maybe it really is time.

806,DunkinDonuts,"with no training, i have to work register, make drinks, and work the window, all at once, for the entirety of the shift (6am-noon). i had to figure all of it out on my own, because we‚Äôre too understaffed for anyone to teach me how to use the equipment. 

i‚Äôve never seen such a clusterfuck of chaos until i started this job, where next to nobody has over a month of experience, and those that do don‚Äôt communicate (in english at the very least). 

at my location, there‚Äôs a guy who works 13 hours a day, 7 days a week, doesn‚Äôt wear a mask, has coughing fits 24/7, and refuses to wash his hands (which he coughs into). today, he left early and i‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs in the hospital. not to mention, nobody else changes their gloves, washes their hands, or follows any covid safety protocols. 

i‚Äôm so fucking thankful that i have other job opportunities, because i can‚Äôt do this shit, especially not for $12.50 an hour. plus, we‚Äôre only allowed one break per 8 consecutive hours, and the break is a maximum of 15 minutes. 

i know this just sounds like me complaining, but as a kid fresh out of high school trying to save for college, this is a shit job. i refuse to buy anything from dunkin, and i‚Äôm probably going to quit to pursue another, safer, better paying job. anyone else have a similar experience?",started working at dunkin recently. i fucking hate it.

for one of them, it seems to vary across their stores. almond milk used to be $0.50 across the board. but now only some of their stores have it at $0.50.

for their other stores, almond milk is $0.59 if it‚Äôs added to a drink, like a hot/iced coffee or cold brew with almond milk in it. and if a drink is made with almond milk, like a latte or cappuccino made with almond milk, they now charge $1.09 for it.

i think it‚Äôs ridiculous that almond milk is costing this much now. why won‚Äôt they keep it as $0.50? lots of people have dairy allergies or intolerances. i haven‚Äôt checked the other nondairy milks, but i imagine they did the same price raises üôÑ",is anyone else‚Äôs local dunkin‚Äôs raising the price for almond milk?

the hazelnut shot is terrible. barely noticeable. maybe even a little bitter. french vanilla swirl is too sweet and caramel swirl is the same. i just don't understand. isn't hazelnut the second most beloved flavor of coffee after french vanilla? why would they get of a coffee staple? i'm baffled.

863,DunkinDonuts,"i ordered it today at a location that wasn‚Äôt my normal one, and the whipped cream was completely covered in cinnamon! i was just wondering if that‚Äôs normal and if i should ask for no cinnamon next time i order or if that was just what this location was doing as i know there can be some differences across the board. thank you!",what is the salted caramel signature latte normally topped with?

866,DunkinDonuts,"this feels like a dumb question but my dunkin‚Äô always has a difficult time getting my order correct. in the app for a medium caramel iced coffee everything basically gets 3 pumps. but when  i order mine the only thing i change is the cream.. i bring to 1.

i swear starbucks has got these people thinking if they say ""caramel latte"" they're supposed to automatically get something sugary sweet and pretty with whipped cream on top. they act like we're getting on their nerves when we ask ""hot or iced."" it's baffling and very frustrating. i can't tell you how many friends i've had geek over coffee until i offered them some straight out of the pot. it's like people have genuinely forgotten that coffee is hot bean piss and not a made up ice cream flavor.",a customer just asked me if we could put cherries on top of her frappes...

914,DunkinDonuts,"hi everyone, i've had a perplexing morning and was hoping to get some answers from the loyal fans of dd, 

full disclosure, i've never been to dunkin donuts before today. before i met my wife, i'd spent the majority of my life in a small town where your best bet for coffee drinks was mcdonald's (even that was only after they introduced the mccafe line-up). i'd heard of dd and seen some commercials, but never actually been to one myself. 

my wife and i currently live in a more populated area with tons of options for coffee (not joking, i didn't know what a macchiato was until i was 32), and today on my way home from work she asked me to stop in the dunkins drive-through. one iced coffee with 10 creams 4 sugars, and a side of mini hashbrowns. 

here's where it gets prickly, at the end, she mentioned she wanted an order of ""dumpy dunks"". when i asked her what those were she said they were similar to donut holes. when i pulled up to the drive-through window to place the order, everything went smooth until i couldn't find ""dumpy dunks"" anywhere on the menu. i asked the person taking my order if they had been discontinued and after a while of pausing he said he didn't remember that product ever being sold in store (he also mentioned that he was new). for the next 5 minutes, i waited as he asked different employees in the store if they had ever sold ""dumpy dunks"", all of which said no. 

is it possible this item was regional? or did i just get pranked by my wife?","new to dunkins, might have gotten pranked by my wife"
915,DunkinDonuts,lately just been getting my iced drinks with just almond milk and realizing it's actually good just like that. might get like some cold foam or a pump of this just for a certain flavor. i could never be a plain coffee drinker with nothing else added. i've tried that many times and failed to like it. but as someone that eats a lot of sugary snacks every day i try to cut back on sugar when i can. i don't get people that get a sweet shot and then add real sugar on top of that just seems crazy.,sometimes you don't need any added sugar at all
916,DunkinDonuts,"i went to three different local dunkin's the other day. one of them only had chocolate and glazed. the other had chocolate + glazed + jelly. i asked this place why they don't have powdered / cinnamon and they said that they only order what sells the best. now of course they would know more than me but i find it hard to believe powdered munchkins don't sell.

920,DunkinDonuts,"so it seems like four out of five times that i ask for flavor shots instead of swirls (which is always), i get my cup and look at the tag on the side to see ""swirls"" listed despite asking for shots. this is at multiple different dunkins throughout the state. i am on a very low-sugar diet, so it's basically a wasted coffee for me at that point unless i inevitably give it to someone else. however, what boggled my mind was a few hours ago when this happened to me i made my order (iced coffee, stevia, oat milk, 4 french vanilla flavor shots) and was asked to confirm if i meant ""unsweetened french vanilla"".   


i was under the impression that all of the flavor shots were ""unsweetened"" so i said yes. couldn't go wrong that way, right? got my coffee and it had 4 swirls listed on the tag.  


am i doing something wrong in ordering? is it possible that they actually are flavor shots but are simply misprinted on the tag (i ask this because i've had family taste-test my coffee and say that it tastes too bland/not sweet enough to be full of swirls). just wondering if i'm the only one running into this issue.",always seem to get swirls instead of shots?
921,DunkinDonuts,"why is this important to know? because i‚Äôve noticed a lot of posts in this sub questioning why their dunks has different rules/policies/procedures/deals etcetera. it‚Äôs because many locations are franchises and have different owners who set their own rules. some places can take tips, some can‚Äôt. some managers have to do refunds, some don‚Äôt. please, as a former employee, stop using the ‚Äúthey do it for me at x dunkins‚Äù because honestly we don‚Äôt care what they do for you at another store we have to follow the rules of our location and if we cant give you something because our jobs are at stake,  people take it out on the employees. it‚Äôs just something to remember. similar to many fast food places. franchises run the majority so uniformity will not be identical between stores. things like quality obviously should be identical but dunkins and many other places have struggled during this pandemic and training for new employees is basically nothing. they‚Äôre thrown on the floor and told to start working day 1 or day 2, i‚Äôve seen it. if a mistake happens just be polite about it. and remember different franchises have different policies. thanks for coming to my tedtalk",psa: dunkins has many franchises!

with [the news](https://i.imgur.com/xkxeit6.jpg) that the dunkaccino is being eliminated, i'm understandably crushed. so someone said to me, ""maybe you can find a local store that's going to get rid of the machine and ask if you can have or buy it.""

1) i am the closing shift lead at my store, and tonight i was closing with our newest hire (i've only closed w them twice). they had to leave at 7:00 (when our store closes) because they had another engagement to attend that night, and as long as the store is closed well, i'm super chill w my workers, so i told them that if we buckled down and really got to work we could probably get out at 7:00. i started assigning them a few tasks, and got to work on tasks that i think take the longest and rarely get done well (i.e. dishes, restocking/cleaning sandwich, cleaning taps, mopping). however, when i checked in on the other closer, they had taken off their headset and were making tiktoks. frequently throughout the night, they were taking 30 min bathroom breaks, making tiktoks, or just standing around. they refused to put their headset back on, leaving me to take orders, make food and drinks, and do the closing tasks myself. when they took out the trash, a bag split open. they came in and told me, so i told them that if there was plastic and shit everywhere they should sweep it up. they got upset and said ""fine, i guess ill go sweep the street."" they left with a broom, but after we finished closing and were walking to our cars i saw with my own eyes that they had not swept it up as there was still plastic and shit everywhere. i couldnt even clean it up because the store was locked. on top of all of that, when i asked them to finish up dishes, they looked at me angry and asked what i was going to do. as if im not the shift lead. as if i hadnt done the majority of the close by myself. anyways. im not the confrontational type, but if tomorrow wasnt my last day i wouldve become the confrontational type. 

2) my store is completely short staffed and has been since i started. however, the whole store is falling apart now. my manager, assistant manager, and the other shift lead along with about 3-4 other employees are all quitting. tomorrow is my last day. there will only be abt 3 ppl on staff after this week. our dunkin upper management has been awful to us. forcing us to cut hours for everyone, having maybe two ppl on the clock while having our lobby and drive thru open, overworking salary employees with no compensation. everyone is fed up. our store is falling apart.

1011,DunkinDonuts,any employees know how these new omelette bites are made? i love the egg white ones and feel like they wouldn't be too difficult to make at home in like a muffin tin or something. but i've never had an omelette with quite this fluffy/sponges texture and was wondering what the process is.,omelette bites
1012,DunkinDonuts,"before i start, i want to say that i have worked on valentines day before. while not at dunkin, i worked at a flower shop that is a big staple of my city, so i know the rush that popular stores get on this day firsthand

i‚Äôve only experienced one holiday at dunkin so far and it was thanksgiving. thanksgiving as a holiday was one i didn‚Äôt expect to be so pressuring, we had a line around the store and inside the lobby with the drink tickets nearly hitting the floor at some points. it was an extremely stressful and pressuring day that lead me to have at least 2 breakdowns due to the fast-paced environment my brain couldn‚Äôt keep up with.

my coworkers have already warned me about valentines day, they say its awful, and i can only imagine it both from personal experience and then comparing that with how thanksgiving was, i don‚Äôt think i would be emotionally prepared to handle it. 

i‚Äôd like to take off both to keep myself out of pressure and for my own stress not to put more pressure on my coworkers who witness me break from the weight. i‚Äôve already put in the request form but have gotten no reply or such yet. my main fear is that my coworkers will see me as lazy or unreliable for bailing on them on such a busy holiday but a part of me says i‚Äôd rather them be mad at me for that than have them deal with my mental state taking such a hit by trying to keep a pace i may not be able to, even if ive taken my medication.",is it wrong for me to request off for valentines day?
1013,DunkinDonuts,"i‚Äôve worked at a new england franchisee owned dunkin since 2018. ask me some questions, things you wanna know in store, how we make stuff etc. i‚Äôll answer what i can from my experience and i wanna know what people wanna see from the inside‚Ä¶. it‚Äôs an experiment:)",what do you wanna know?
1014,DunkinDonuts,"some of my dunkin stores are starting to close at 4pm, 5pm, 6pm. i am assuming they restock their donut selection at least twice a day. once when they open at 6am and another time.... when?

i'm trying to gauge what time in the afternoon is a good time for me to visit. i've gone a few times at 10am, 11am, and 3pm. donuts were hard and didn't taste fresh.

1016,DunkinDonuts,i usually get my iced coffee between 2-6 when it‚Äôs 2.00 here. i recently found out that dd has a senior discount. i‚Äôm not sure if you can use these two offers together. wanted to say also that i visit 3 different dd‚Äôs and everyone has the most friendly and helpful people working there. i‚Äôve been going for years and it‚Äôs always a great experience. you all make people happy‚Ä¶.wanted to share that. üòä,senior discount question
1017,DunkinDonuts,i have a free drink coupon and i can‚Äôt decide what to use it on. i never try out new things and always stick with plain lattes or caramel lattes!,caramel macchiato or caramel signature latte?
1018,DunkinDonuts,"i never create posts but this is postworthy. i stopped drinking caffeine around 3 weeks ago, and have been solely drinkng tea and matcha lattes.  just tried dunkin's matcha latte (iced), and i got it with coconutmilk instead of whole milk. **best.drink.ever**. this one is so much better than starbucks imo, and a way better size for the price. the coconut is such a surprisingly good pair for the matcha. just felt i would share if you're looking for a simple way to spice up your daily coffee/matcha routine!! lmk if you try and like it!!",best matcha drink ever!!!
1019,DunkinDonuts,"i want to begin this post by reminding everyone that it is illegal for your employer to retaliate against you for discussing your wages, and if they do so, sue the pants off of them.

at my dunkin, i make $14.50/hour. the state minimum wage is $14.25. we get a raise every new year, when the state increases the minimum wage, and that‚Äôs it. the openers, closers, and shift leaders all make the same amount ($14.50) as well. 

when covid first hit, we had $2 added on to our check for every hour we worked (so if you worked 20 hours, $40 would be added to your check, not an extra $2/hour. apparently we‚Äôre not worth that much even during a global pandemic). last year, in i believe november, they added an extra $1/hour raise to our pay that was supposed to be permanent as well (minimum wage then was $13.50/hour, so we were making $14.50/hour). that was the last raise we saw.

the pay is really insulting, especially with basically no benefits. we can get health insurance thru dunkin at my location, but it is very expensive and covers jack shit. next door at mcdonald‚Äôs, they get $17/hour with tuition coverage, and other benefits as well as better pay. the other 2 stores i work next to also pay about ~$17/hour. why shouldn‚Äôt my coworkers and i all quit and work there? even other franchises offer better benefits. in the next town over from mine, there is a franchise that will pay your tuition. and for having to get food out the drive thru window in 150 seconds or less, it‚Äôs ridiculously low.

i also don‚Äôt count tips in this, as some stores make worse tips and some shifts also have worse tips than others, and they really should be paying us more anyway. it‚Äôs not like they don‚Äôt have the money.

just some thoughts though.",how much do you get paid at your dunkin? (not including tips)
1020,DunkinDonuts,"every time cold cup designs change i assume a given store has an unused pile to deal with... are they just tossed, always sent to recycling, or varies by store and/or franchisee?

the reason i ask is we're planning some stem recycling programs at our makerspace, and could put some amount of them to repurposed use. so curious if that's a per-store level decision or we have to go to the franchisee. if it matters, the main franchisee around us is andrade group (nh)...","when cold cup designs change are old cups tossed, recycled, or it varies?"

1029,DunkinDonuts,"to start - in case this is regional - i live in central virginia.   the three stores near me have decals on the windows saying something like dd perk members - free medium or hot on wednesdays.  i went to a store last wednesday and ordered a medium iced.  i showed my app at the drive thru and it deducted the full price from my gift card.  i then asked for a receipt and it showed i paid for the coffee.  i then told the worker it was supposed to be free.  he said he did not know of any promo.  he then asked the manager and she said she knew about the sign but if the register did not take it off as free there is nothing she can do.  she said it did not show as free in ‚Äúoffers‚Äù section of the app and i should only count on it as a promo if it shows in the offers section.  

i contacted dd customer service through the app and they gave me a free beverage coupon to even in out.

1038,DunkinDonuts,"hey everyone, is it dunkins policy to refuse refunds on orders they mess up?


i had a terrible experience today on my way to work.   ordered a black pepper bacon sandwich, but charged for a  maple sugar bacon sandwich, then when i get to work and take out my sandwich, it is just some bacon on a crossoint, no egg.

the phone number goes straight to voice-mail, then tells me the mailbox is full so i have to drive back after work.

the doors are locked(i know, pandemic) so i have to go back thru the drive thru.  finally able explain what happened and am told no refunds, but they will give the correct sandwich.  i ordered the sandwich for breakfast 6 hours earlier, it does me nothing to finally get it now nor does it address my wasted time.


so i am asking, do you guys really refuse refunds when you mess up someone's order?  or am i dealing with a poorly run franchise?

i choose splenda to avoid the added sugar and extra calories (i know there‚Äôs debate over the healthiness or artificial sweeteners), but confused on how 4 sugars (the default on the app for choosing regular sugar for a large) is an entire 35 grams. i assumed one sugar was one of those little packets or a teaspoon.","how many grams is one sugar? one large iced latte with sugar has 35 grams of added sugar, seems excessive for 4 sugars (default on the app)."

1087,DunkinDonuts,"hey guys, serious question and i'm hoping to find responses from people who understand/are going through the same thing.

before i explain my story, please note that i am not a lazy person, i am extremely active and exercise as much as a i can. i was actually pretty thin a decade ago.

when i started working third shift, i became addicted to coffee (which sounds like it'd be obvious lol).  my town had just been introduced to dunkin's iced coffees (keep in mind this was 14 years ago).  i would get a coffee every so often, then it turned into every day.  i can honestly say for the last 10 years, i've had at least one iced coffee a day from dunkin donuts. and also for the last 10 years, i've struggled losing weight no matter how hard i worked out.  i've been checked by my doctor for various things, nothing shows as to why i cannot lose the weight.

my boyfriend (who has always been rail thin) just recently started drinking a lot of dunkin and starbucks and now he has a little belly on him.  i am starting to put two and two together here.

today, i am quitting my dunkin habit. i know it'll be hard but i feel i need to do it. my body is suffering because of a daily coffee routine i became addicted to.

my question is..... do any of you have similar experience with this?  or is this all just a coincidence.",do you think dunkin donuts coffee has contributed to sever weight gain?

i mean dunkin donuts rush hour, to put it bluntly, is fucking insane, on like my second day at working at dunkin i was expected to make like 10 drinks in 3 minutes. its absolutely ludicrous and me being a new hire imagine trying to ask questions regarding things during rush hour. shits absolutely mad and honestly quite stressful.

im not planning on quitting right and i want to give it time to see if it becomes easier but holy crap man. dunkin donuts probably has one of the craziets rush hours i've ever seen at a fast food place.

1163,DunkinDonuts,"can anyone please explain why dunkin donuts changed their coffee lids from the old fashioned design where the lid plug was integrated in the lid and now the newer style has the open mouthpiece with the separate plastic dipstick? this design sucks for a few reasons‚Ä¶
‚Ä¢ this change took place around covid starting. why would you want to incorporate a separate plastic piece that must be handled by the employee before it goes into your drink? i‚Äôve seen the bins they are kept in behind the counter. not sanitary and the employee touches multiple sticks each time they reach for one.
‚Ä¢ it is inconvenient when you just want to reach for your drink with one hand but now have a dipstick to pull out first.
‚Ä¢ when you remove the dipstick you sometimes have to put it down somewhere if you plan on taking multiple sips before replugging. now you are potentially introducing the stick to more germs when placing it down.
‚Ä¢ wouldn‚Äôt it cost more money for this design since you are now bringing in additional inventory at each location? 
‚Ä¢ isn‚Äôt this adding to waste and impacting the environment that you market yourself caring about?
‚Ä¢ i don‚Äôt enjoy getting to the bottom of my cup and finding the shaft of a broken stick because the employee grabbed one without a head and dropped it in. yes this happened to me today. luckily i didn‚Äôt swallow it and choke.",coffee cup lid change

to run some things by off the bat, i'm 19, this is my second job, and i have autism, adhd, and anxiety. all of these i try not to have hinder my work while on on the clock, but sometimes events get the best of me.

today a woman, her relative/friend, and a young boy approached the register. the woman's friend/relative ordered for her, she said 3 blueberry donuts and a coffee roll. i repeated this back to her and she confirmed it. i cashed her out, gave her change, the whole one two. i'm already a few hours into my shift and its a rush hour so i'm a bit tired, annoyed, and very slightly overwhelmed.

i grab a bag for the donuts. she says she wants a box. annoying ok sure. i grab a box for 6 donuts and start putting them in there. no, thats the wrong box. at this point i had barely known about muffin boxes, so i was confused on what other box there was. my coworker grabs a muffin box. ok cool.

i put the donuts in the box. at this point shes now questioning why im giving her donuts, and tells me she ordered *muffins.* while its a common mistake especially when my hearings fucked from wearing a headset all day, it was tipping me off my mental edge. i knew if i didn't go to the back and take a breather i would snap *at* her. my emotions were already tipping, so i turn around towards the back and just go ""ineedaminuteineedaminutepleasegivemeaminute"" *(repeating sentences when im stressed is a mental response of mine, though i'm not sure what its fully linked to its usually based on people not listening to me the first time)* and when i did come back out after letting some of my anger/stress out, the womans at the counter pointing and screaming at me.

i couldn't hear what she was saying fully, but the jist of it was shit like im disrespectful, i was yelling at her, etc. and my coworkers told me to just ignore her, meaning i couldnt even explain myself / tell her that i was never *intending* to yell at her. and once she left my coworkers basically took a side with her, saying that i was being disrespectful to her and even if i didn't snap at her like i almost did, if my franchise owner saw the video they would insist the customer would be right. 

it's annoying. the customer is always right. that i don't have the chance or right to defend something i did that was taken the wrong way. i don't *want* or *like* to get overwhelmed like that, and no matter how hard i try to keep it from does happening, when it does im still seen as wrong, or annoying, or hard to work with.","""the customer is always right"" annoyance (rant/vent)"

i want to try and. push my crew to start making time, but most of them started when our store was a ‚Äújust please be here and make coffee and take peoples money‚Äù rather than being efficient and trying to keep the 80% and up. 

my manager asked me to make a list of pointers to share with other shift leaders and her as kind of focal points based off of what i had seen, and this is what i have so far

	‚ÅÉ	if you are not busy with customers and you see someone needs help , help- especially drive they, drive thru is priority 
	‚ÅÉ	everyone should be listening for orders to help the ot
	‚ÅÉ	if the ot is busy and you arent, try to jump in and help take orders or run donuts to drive thru
	‚ÅÉ	keep things stocked, if you can‚Äôt get off of your station then ask someone who iant busy to grab something for you
	‚ÅÉ	be efficient, ot should be starting espresso shots for coffees so they are done and the drinks are done faster
	‚ÅÉ	ot should be setting up orders for the window, they should be seeing the next order and making sure everything is ready for hand out
	‚ÅÉ	sandwich station always should have batches of hash browns, snackin bacon, eggs bacon maple bacon and sausage
	‚ÅÉ	when not busy sandwich station should stock and fill bagels in the station as well as make sure everything is filled like cheese snd meats and other breads
	‚ÅÉ	coffees should be making multiple drinks at a time, never one at a time unless there is only one drink to make
	‚ÅÉ	ot should be putting orders in quickly and repeating orders as you go to ensure complete accuracy, be personable and make them feel like you want them there! 
	‚ÅÉ	drive thru if you need help, say you need help whether it‚Äôs sandwiches coffees or something else
	

soooo, what other ideas do you guys have for pushing my crew to start making time? i know some of you will find this post dumb, but i really want to make my store fast again. we used to have an amazing crew who would make time most days of the week and i think we can get there again with our current group!",tips for making time with newer crew?

1208,DunkinDonuts,"my sister just recently started working at dunkins about late september to maybe early october in gales ferry, connecticut from 6am-10am. she loved her job at the store she worked at by as of late november, she was transferred to a gas station/dunkins in groton, connecticut where she'd be working 12pm-5pm. now here comes the real story...and i'm sure i'm not even supposed to post this here but i am so pissed off it's not even funny and i will spread this where ever i need too in order for dunkins to see it and feel the fucking heat because dunkins has removed my facebook post and my twitter post from their page. my sister is 18 years old, has high functioning autism and high anxiety. she applied to dunkins as a way to help support the household since her father passed away in august, she was happy at the gales ferry one; she loved the manager there, she loved her co-workers, and as much as she hated being transferred...she dealt with it. she was there for all of 2, maybe 3 days, before that store manager tells her ""you're closing tomorrow."" on her way out. my sister was scared, she was never trained to close dunkins and assumed someone would be with her the next day...she was wrong. she was given tasks/assignments that she had literally no idea how to do because she wasn't trained in closing the store...she was always out of work by 5:05pm at the latest while someone else closed.  


we had no idea about the no training and also assumed someone would be there with her. i went into the gas station to let her know her ride was there but to also get something to drink and snack on from the gas station only to see my sister on her own, almost in tears because she was so stressed and her anxiety was through the roof. she was alone and as much as the henny penny employee wanted to help her, she couldn't in fear of getting in trouble. so i hung around the gas station, which the henny penny employee was okay with, and watched as my sister struggled to do her tasks. she was supposed to be at 5:00pm and she assumed she'd be there for maybe an extra 30 minutes closing but she was there till about 7:45pm. the manager watching her from home on the cameras and speaking to my sister like she was a fucking idiot on the phone. the management basically threw my sister to the wolves expecting her to know how to do everything. oh but here's the kicker...you all know we gotta wear masks everywhere right? whether you support them or not, you know we gotta wear them cause of covid. well my sister has a low immune system due a livery and kidney issue and our mom has a very low immune system due to 2 autoimmune diseases and she went into work on the first day and wore her mask for about an hour, she went outside to get some fresh air real quick when the manger of that store went after her and told her not to wear her mask because ""it looked unprofessional."" and when my sister tired to fight it, telling them why she needed the mask...they threatened to let her go and in fear of loosing her job, she complied. nobody should be afraid to loose their job because they want to protect them themselves and their loved ones by wearing a fucking mask.

so the next day, december 3 2021, my sister called that store manager and told her she was done. she couldn't handle being left alone and that she was more a team player than a solo player, which that manager rudely remarked ""made no sense"" and hung up on her. on december 4th, my sister messaged the overall manager, i'm not sure which kind of manager she is but she's the one who hired her and she manages multiple groton, ct stores and explained the situation and how she wasn't given any training on how to close, to which the woman rudely remarked was ridiculous, she had two or three months worth of training and it was stupid of my sister to even claim that before saying 'your checks should be available on friday""....excuse me? should?! then she ends it with ""no response necessary"" when my sister was telling her sorry for wasting her time, thanks for the opportunity, and which store was she supposed to pick up her check at? the manager never answered her and if we had to guess, she blocked the number.

1211,DunkinDonuts,"i started at dunkin a month ago now. it's my second job and i really enjoy it. the hours are good, the pay is great (better than my last job at least), and my coworkers are really nice people. however one issue i've already had is getting days off.

my family (specifically my father's side) has a vacation planned for after christmas. not long, from the 28th to the 2nd, so i'd really only be gone 4 days or so. it's 2 hours away, and i can't drive by myself yet (i am over 18 and have a permit). so not only would i want to drive myself to and from my job for 2 hours each, but i don't want anyone else going through the same. 

november 16th. 9 days before thanksgiving i go to request those days off. not even a month before christmas, not even a month before new years, and my workplace has a notice up that they're not accepting any requests off for christmas eve, new years, or new years day. considering i was still in training i didn't even have time to learn how to request off, and now i was smacked in the face with there's not a chance i can get off.

my coworkers noticed my panic, and they agreed with me, it's not fair, i had literally no opportunity to request off. i still filled out a forum anyways and did specify that it was a preplanned thing. however i still get the feeling my shift leader is trying to schedule me for the days i specifically said i would be away (especially since i saw my name in with a list of peoples for that day). 

i plan on going anyways. i fear i may get written up so many times that i'm suspended or fired, but i'd rather be with my family, especially since i don't even get paid my dues yet since i can't make tips for another 2 or 3 months (if i pass my tip test the first time)",the pain of getting days off

today was nearly my breaking point. i got in at 5am. we‚Äôre severely understaffed especially for our location (highway) new person didnt show up and another called 30 minutes after his shift was meant to start saying he was going to be late because of traffic, only to call in again another 30 minutes later saying he wasnt coming in. i got told i had to stay until 2pm. a 9 hour shift. 

it was extremely busy from 6am to 12pm. the owner refuses to buy us enough supplies to last the week. so we were out of milk, skim milk, sugar, and the ice machine is broken. 

theres 5 of us. one is new. its so deeply stressful the whole time. trying to calm customers down when we say theres no sugar. 

all the 12 oclock people leave. 12 oclock people show up. its me and two others. we get a line wrapped around the building. 

a lady starts ordering. this is basically how it goes. 

lady: i want a large frozen coffee with caramel coconut and mocha

coworker: large frozen coffee with caramel, coconut and mocha?

lady: no! i said a large frozen with caramel

coworker: so no coconut or mocha flavoring?

lady: a large frozen coffee. coconut. and mocha. 

coworker: ok, so its a large frozen coffee, with coconut flavoring, and mocha

lady: *loud sigh* i said caramel 

coworker: large coconut, caramel, and mocha?

lady: yes finally you get it right. jesus. 

and she pulls away from the speaker before we can say anything. we are completely confused after she kept changing it and raising her voice. 

she gets to the window, gets her drink and we move on to the next customer. a second later shes still sitting at the window and snapping at us to get out attention. she says her drink is wrong. i read out what was rung up on the register to her. she complains that her coffee is ‚Äúgrainy‚Äù aka: has ice in it. because its a  frozen coffee. so it has shaved ice bits. she says her coffee is never this texture and i try to explain that a frozen coffee is always that texture, or it should be. she raised her voice and repeats her drink to me, differently then she ordered it,  before yelling that shes been waiting too long and just wants her money back. we arent able to do refunds because only the manager is capable of doing that. not that we arent allowed to, but we dont have the option to on the register. 

im at my breaking point. the whole day has been more stressful than any other day here, and ive been working at this location for almost a year. im about to start crying. i quickly tell a coworker she wants her money back so i can step away from the window. 

coworker starts talking to her and trys to explain the situation. she continues yelling at us. claiming she comes here all the time and her drink is never like this. i work 6 days a week. ive never seen her. i dont even know what happened next but suddenly she was gona dn the next car pulled up. now theyve been waiting forever because this lady had to yell at us for making her frozen coffee the way she ordered it. 

the first thing out of this next persons mouth is an exacerbated ‚Äúwhy is this taking so long. are you guys understaffed or something?!‚Äù i almost collapsed to the floor crying. 

like dude, you heard this lady yelling at us, you know it took so long because she wanted to yell at us. why do you also have to act like this. 

the rest of the line went like this. when the line was finally gone a guy came inside. say my mask and went ‚Äúwhy are you wearing a mask. studies show they dont work you should report your employer‚Äù

my brain just,,,, i couldnt respond. i just lied. said it was required, its not. i just want to keep wearing my mask. i work with food, and chemicals to clean things. i like my mask. i like not breathing on peoples food. not breathing in (as much) chemicals. i just didnt have the mental capacity to respond properly. i knew he was gonna argue with me no matter what i said. i just politely took his order.

1247,DunkinDonuts,"i got hired at this particular store by request of the district manager. i was to be the opening shift lead and do some retraining. i accepted the offer but i demanded that i only work 4-6 and the occasional 4-10 on saturdays and sundays.
in the 2-3 months i‚Äôve been doing this i haven‚Äôt left on time once. despite me saying repeatedly that i have another job that‚Äôs more important and takes an hour to get to. this morning the general manager texted me a 5:30 that she was gonna be 30 minutes late and she‚Äôd arrive around 6:30. okay cool, it‚Äôs slow imma vibe. 6:30 roll around nothing. 6:45 nothing. 6:50 the new girl (15)on her second day arrives 20 minutes early for her shift. general manager no where to be found. once the new girl walked in, i transferred the drawer to the other shift lead, placed my key on the counter and proceeded to inform the gm and the regional manager (the district is on maternity leave) that i would be quitting effective immediately. and i went into detail with the regional manager about why i was leaving. as i‚Äôm writing this 37 minutes later they are still texting me and calling me begging me to come back.

i say all that to say: managers do not take advantage of your employees especially the ones you rely on and the ones that keep your staff trained and the store functioning. that includes the bakers.

1248,DunkinDonuts,"hi everyone. i know everywhere is short staffed, and dunkin employees don't make shit for money, and as a fellow service employee i'd hate to be disrespectful or make an employee upset. 

i ordered a large iced latte with whole milk and white chocolate swirl today in the app, and when i went in to get my order it looked a little dark but i thought it was fine. i took a sip and it was so bitter! i ordered the same thing from the same dunkin 3 days in a row so i knew this wasn't right. i walked back to my car and took a few more sips and i just couldn't do it. so i went back in politely asked if i could have it remade with a little more milk. the employee seemed fine (not overjoyed, obviously) to remake it, and said she read the order wrong. but i just feel so bad!

the second mistake was far worse. i was given a hot coffee by an employee and i capped it, noticing it was slightly indented at the bottom but i brushed it off. then i capped on the lid and made sure it was on, but when i gave it to him it popped off and the hot coffee burned both our fingers. he and his wife yelled ‚Äúfuck!‚Äù and he looked mad. i was shocked and said ‚Äúomg i‚Äôm so sorry are you ok‚Äù and he shrugged. i couldn‚Äôt explain the feeling in my stomach after that happened 

i‚Äôve worked for 3 months too and an employee who was assigned to work here laughed when another employee said i‚Äôve been working that long, and said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way‚Äù. 

i have some social anxiety and also was diagnosed with high functioning autism and this job just makes me feel worse about myself. can someone say mistakes they‚Äôve done to make me feel better?",keep crying over my mistakes at work‚Ä¶

1298,DunkinDonuts,"why did they change the vanilla/ french vanilla  flavor , and make it some strange tasting foul chemical that people hate?

this causes the entire coffee to be ruined and needs to be throw out. 

is it because the people at dunkin donuts don't care about the quality of the product they sell?

they made this change more than a year ago, and i recall the employees were in shock and everyone complained .",why did dunkin donuts ruin their coffee ??

1327,DunkinDonuts,"okay so today was my third day back and i work overnights at my store! 4 days i do dt and the other two days i‚Äôll be covering the baker‚Äôs days off.

i worked dt today and i got almost everything stocked perfectly; if i were to think about what i didn‚Äôt check it what i definitely missed, it would include:
- filling the sugar dispenser and splenda dispenser
- cutting lemons
- filling cups underneath the drive thru and front counter stations
- i also forgot to check cold brew oops!

what i did do?
- cleaned and fully stocked the donut case (donut and munchkin boxes, made sure bags were full, etc)
- stocked coke cooler and the two mini fridges 
- all 11 remakes
- most of the dishes (i help it the baker and do most of his when i can)
- trash (got busy so baker took it to dumpster but i gathered it all)
- stocked sandwich station fully
- ran drive thru alone as i do nightly until 5 am
- checked to make sure dairy machines were full
- checked swirls to make sure they weren‚Äôt low
- put bagels and croissants in case and sandwich statiob

my job is not to make up for what other shifts didn‚Äôt stock. know how many lemons i go through overnight? none. know what that means? 6-midnight should‚Äôve done it. i didn‚Äôt have time to as it got busy but even then that is not something that should‚Äôve even been empty to be held against me!!!

my night was pretty slow but i‚Äôm also getting used to the grind again as i left at the end of april. i did forget to check the sugar and splenda dispensers but it was busy and all of the morning shift people were there anyways!!

okay, on to the important part. first off, i don‚Äôt get out of the window until 6:20 even though i should be clocked out by 6. whatever, happens all the time idrc . that being said, i‚Äôm already about to be in overtime so i counted my drawer and clocked out‚Ä¶ it was 30 mins into a full on morning shift, they had it handled and if i missed a couple things one f the many people could do it while up front was slow!

i‚Äôm sitting in the back because i didn‚Äôt take a break all night and i figure i‚Äôd talk to my manager when she comes in because i hadn‚Äôt gotten to bullshit with her since coming back.

i guess this morning shift girl didn‚Äôt know i was still in the back because suddenly i hear her talking about how i didn‚Äôt do ‚Äúmuch of any thing ‚Äú and then my other coworkers and friends were telling her that it‚Äôs my third day back and i work on my own all night etc. girl is newer and was all confused talking about how doesnt she have another person? bitch yeah, the baker who is baking all night not stocking your sugar machine?

anyway she talked all this shut literally 20 feet away from me on the other side of the wall because i was in the back and she was talking to the baker at the bakers table which is very close to the back. 

i‚Äôm like shaking with anger because i was so nice to this girl and she just watched me run order taking and window for an extra 20 minutes over my shift and she has the nerve to be talking shit about someone who works her ass off? so i got up and started telling her all the stuff i do overnight and how i‚Äôm so sorry her sugar and lemons weren‚Äôt full but she has all her remakes and a full donut case etc

she finishes cutting lemons and doesn‚Äôt even look at me and walks to go out them away and i‚Äôm talking louder so she can still hear me and she‚Äôs looking around like ‚Äúwho is she talking to?‚Äù and my baker is like ‚Äúyou‚Äù but then he scolds me and tells me to go sit down because he was already defending me  ‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è

anyways my manager the bajer abd the morning shift lead and i all talked shit about her when my manager came in lmao and the baker was telling my manager about how much more i do than anyone else here and it made my heart full ü•∫ü•∫

1342,DunkinDonuts,i currently work at arby's and i'm thinking about working at dunkin. i'm wondering how stressful it is compared to arby's. at arby's there's car after car after car. the longest we go without a car is 10 minutes and that's about two to three times a day. in that time i have to rush to stock and clean. it's usually just a constant rush of cars with no break in between. i'm pushed a lot to be fast ( i have to be done making the food in 30-45 seconds) in order to get a good dt time. i also get no breaks so it's a constant 7+ hours on my feet. i'm pretty sure dunkin is also under inspire brands so i can imagine there's similar procedure. i'm wondering if someone could give me an idea on how stressful it'll be. i'm getting tired of the gm's constant lash outs about the dt time when i'm the only one on backline most of the time and i'm still expected to help fry station and the running position. we also opened our lobby back up recently so it's 5x worst. i'm trying to leave asap but i don't want to go into something more stressful. i can handle the stress and fast paced environment pretty well but some days i just get tired of it all and my gm does not help.,thinking about working here
1343,DunkinDonuts,there's this one dunkin in my area that use to be 24/7. and they use to always be on point. then the pandemic hit and they switched their hours to opening up at 6am. ever since then they don't even open the store at 6am. and when they do open up maybe a half hour later. they then they'll all the customers that the oven won't be on to 7am. in my head i'm thinking why not just open up at 7am then? take the full entire hour from 6am-7am to prep your opening. so you can avoid having a bunch of angry customers that probably won't return anymore.,anybody have one of those dunkins that are never ready when they are open?

1354,DunkinDonuts,"so back in 2017-2018 i loved the winter white chocolate swirl (i think it was from december - february too) and would buy it every day, to the point the woman at the counter was like ""oh, one second and i will make it for you!"" lol. those were my junior semesters of college and needless to say i gained like 15 pounds at the end of it. so stressful. i haven't had the white chocolate since... but immediately this morning when i smelled my coffee cup i was transported back to my college library, cramming in a tiny cubicle for finals. 

i think this version is less sweet and/or potent than the winter white chocolate i remember. i always got 2 swirls 2 cream in a medium hot and this one tastes much weaker than i remember. idk, i know the coffee varies so much too. i will definitely be trying it again! i still do get a slight toasted marshmallow smell and flavor. 

the pancakes! i saw y'all bash them a bit but honestly i liked them. a little dry and cold but folded in half and dipped in the syrup they weren't that bad. i tasted maybe a hint of orange or citrus of some kind. perhaps they were next to the muffins but idk. lol. i thought they were on par with other fast food pancake options.

1357,DunkinDonuts,"so i usually go for a small french vanilla swirl iced coffee w regular milk, and depending on the location i'll end up with 2 or 3 shots. perfect. well obviously it's getting freezing out, so i wanted to try the hot version instead. the girl who was working made me sound dumb when i admitted i didn't know exactly what to order to get a similar taste, so i just said french vanilla swirl coffee w regular milk. it tasted sort of bitter to me. so i'm wondering how to get a bit of sweetness back, would i just ask for an extra pump of vanilla or something? i'm trying to avoid giving workers a migraine at 6am when i'm trying to order lol, i'll admit i dont know the first thing about coffee and how to order it since i made it myself for so long but no longer have access to a coffee machine",idiot trying to order coffee- what exactly should i ask for?
1358,DunkinDonuts,"hard pass for me. 
i can‚Äôt get past this odd taste they have i don‚Äôt know why i thought they‚Äôd taste like the eggo mini pancakes (üò≠). i tried to eat three, the first one i wasn‚Äôt quite sure i thought it was because of the mint aftertaste from this mornings teeth wash. so i tried another (without syrup) which it wasn‚Äôt me it was the actual pancake itself that taste off. i gave it another go for the third time with syrup in hopes it‚Äôll help me overcome the taste as i really love pancakes. the syrup did not help what so ever‚Äî too watery. and the pancake flavor overpowered it. i also tried nuking the pancakes for a few more seconds (the first time it came out soggy) thinking that would help but to no avail‚Äîin the trash they went. (‚Äò:",thoughts on dunkin‚Äô pancake minis?
1359,DunkinDonuts,"after the mostly negative reviews of both items, i got curious. i tried the coffee medium, 3 white chocolate, 3 vanilla shots, almond milk. it was good. definitely tasted different than the regular coffee. a tiny bit more sweet.

now, on to the pancakes. i got mines and they were cold. i tried them without syrup. they weren't overly sweet, which was good. despite being cold, they weren't dry. i was prepared for them to be the same consistency of the cake donuts. lol but the syrup with the pancakes were quite enjoyable, especially with the coffee. the only thing slightly negative i'd say is that the pancakes don't fit into the syrup packet. most people eat these on the go and won't be placing these on plates and pouring syrup on them. i had to rip them in half to dunk them. so either make the syrup container rounder or make the pancake sticks.

1360,DunkinDonuts,"i'm having nothing but issues with dunkin's iced coffees lately. it doesn't taste like they add any swirls at all anymore.

the french vanilla one used to be sufficient to give the drink a creamy, sweet flavor without any added cream or sugar, but the last one i had tasted like coffee with ice and nothing more which was a real disappointment since the location i got it from is usually really good about making great tasting drinks. 

i contacted corporate and they just threw 200 points in my account and didn't acknowledge my complaint about the inconsistency of their drinks across locations, or even based on what time you visit or who makes the coffee (i've observed some employees not even putting full pumps of the swirls in my cup even though all my locations have starting charging extra for additional pumps).

today i used the points from corporate to get a large peppermint mocha iced coffee at a different location than last time and it tastes neither like peppermint or mocha. it took me awhile to place it, but i swear it tastes like gingerbread which is odd because i don't even see that as a flavor option. what is going on?

1361,DunkinDonuts,"i've been working at dunkin for a few months now and explicitly told the manager i didn't want to be a closer because i don't like being left alone to work by myself. our store doesn't have a drive-thru but we do take mobile orders, uber eats, and doordash orders. however, the store closes at 9pm. on weekdays, one person stays to help the closer and leaves at 6 or 7pm, leaving the closer by themselves from then until 9pm. on sundays, the person helping the closer leaves at 5pm (before the recently new manager, this was 4pm) and the closer must take customers, perform any and all cleaning and stocking, and any closing tasks, all while still getting mobile orders, by themselves. the last manager asked if i could close sundays until he could hire someone to close 3 days a week because we were understaffed, so i agreed to do it for a few weeks. fast forward a little over a month and a half and i'm still closing sundays, being left alone from 5-9. its hella stressful when you've got mobile orders for food and drinks at 7pm and a line of people in the store, ordering a bunch of shit. anytime i tell people i'm by closing the store by myself, they're suprised they dont have more than one person doing it. dunkin's reasoning is that sunday is the slowest day for our store, or they dont have money in the budget to schedule more people (min. wage at my store is $15). i wanted to know if this is normal or if the owners are just exploiting workers to pay the mininum and make the most",one person closing

1390,DunkinDonuts,"hello dunkin workers, i have a question for you. last week i was getting a medium midnight roast every day - i love the taste and it's less acidic than the normal blend. reminds me of a nice dark moka pot coffee. 

anyway, this week, two days in a row i have gotten home and it tastes like they are just giving me the normal blend, which i don't like. 

today i went back and told them that two days now it tastes like i'm being given the normal roast, because it tastes nothing like last week.  ive worked retail before, so i wasn't karening them, just stating that it tastes nothing like what i had all last week. 

i appreciate that they gave me a new drink, but as expected, they were being passive aggressive/accusatory with how the original drink was definitely midnight.  

just for note, i brew with a french press, pour over, aero press, moka pot, and even a manual espresso machine at home - so it's pretty obvious to me when i'm given the wrong coffee. and the difference between normal roast and midnight is night and day (hehe..)

my question, any they likely just giving me normal blend because they don't want to brew midnight, or is there a way they are just not brewing it right?  if they don't feel like brewing it, i don't care, just tell me you're out and don't make me waste my time and money.

1396,DunkinDonuts,"hello, and good morning! i just wanted to share my experiences with dunkin. i have been getting a coffee every morning for the past 4-5 months. my addiction first began when i went to buy my office 2 dozen donuts. i smelled this chocolate drink, which the person who ordered it wasn't happy about, but anyway after that i decided to buy one myself. its called the cochamocha, i bought one and loved it. i started getting one every morning during the week. but i've noticed that 3-4 times out of 10 my order is wrong. sometimes they don't add the foam, sometimes, they make it iced instead of hot, and sometimes i don't even know what they do wrong. 
its expensive getting coffee every morning, and i've started making my own recipe at home.(i use dark chocolate, swiss chocolate mix, instant espress, and attempt to froth my own whole milk. its not bad at all!) all i need to do is buy a latte machine, and then i can say goodbye to dunkin. 
most issues with my order are that it tastes nothing like a cochamocha, and when i try to bring up the issues with the staff they are very rude. they get an attitude. i walk up and say ""i'm sorry, i ordered a cochamocha, but this doesn't taste like it."" i try my best to be polite but they always get cold with me. its to the point where i don't want to bother them. i don't want anyone spitting in my drink. i had one lady give me the finger because instead of fixing my drink she just added whipcream and i came back after work to see if someone else could fix it. 
getting the wrong order can really screw up your morning. i need the extra caffeine. i work with dementia patients so i need all the energy i can get! a wrong order happened again today, so that is why i am writing this. does anyone else have a similar experience to me? any advice? thank you for taking the time to read this, have a nice day! :)

personally i really don't care how i get my cream cheese. but i'm wondering if something changed behind the scenes, do some locations not have little things of it anymore and only have like a big tub?

1419,DunkinDonuts,"im an assistant manager at the location i work at. it's me, the store manager, &amp; we only have 1 shift lead atm. i get along pretty well with the store manager but definitely have my thoughts about her..

first-- i work way more hrs than she does, fine whatever. she also consistently comes in 5/10min late everyday (7am.) she never opens &amp; im the main opener, which i dont mind cuz im a morning person anyways &amp; i get out early. 

theres been multiple times where everyone (usually 1 or 2 other people) dont show up to open with me &amp; im completely by myself. i make this known in our group chat app, where i see that she sees it but never replies &amp; still comes in at her scheduled time-- which i feel like if ur the store manager it should be ur responsibility to step up if you know someone is literally alone at the store working.. 

yesterday i was due in at 5am &amp; she was surprisingly there at 4:30am opening by herself (usually i do that) &amp; i was standing at the back door about to walk in when it hit 5:01am &amp; shes already sending me txts asking me where im at &amp; also posting in the group chat. this is from the same woman whose left me alone to run the entire store 3 times &amp; seemed to not give af but ofc when shes alone for 1 fuckin min shes blowing my shit up.. ive gone 3hrs with no help before (granted i did have to tell people that i couldn't make food atm since it was impossible.)

she also disappears to do paperwork/money, etc.. in the office &amp; is gone off the floor at peak rush times, even when theres only 3 of us at a time. i have noticed shes gotten better with this lately tho (thank god) but she then chooses to go run to the bank at the very last minute before a shift change. as an assistant i cannot leave if shes gone at the bank before a shift change cuz i need to stay &amp; make sure everyone whos due to work shows up. i get that but there's been times where regular crew members also can't leave cuz the person relieving them is late &amp; shes gone at the bank. 

im just so fuckin annoyed by her &amp; her ""rules for thee but not for me"" attitude. sorry i just had to get that off my chest. feel free to leave ur own horror stories! all employees of dunkin should seriously hold a convention to collectively get together &amp; bitch about shit like this.",just a rant about my manager (rant with me!)

1474,DunkinDonuts,it's kind of hard for me to drink iced coffee these days. i had one the other day by mistake. because the guy thought i said pumpkin iced latte. when i said pumpkin iced chai latte. and it was like a revelation just came over me. that if i have the choice i would take the iced chai and matcha each and every time. i still like iced coffee but it's on the back burner these days.,anybody realize overtime they are more of a chai &amp; matcha drinker? rather than coffee
1475,DunkinDonuts,i noticed for months my dunkin keeps the mobile order drinks/food behind the counter now. there is a designated mobile pick up table in the store still but everytime i go it sits behind the counter. is there a reason for this and are other stores doing this as well?,mobile orders ready behind counter
1476,DunkinDonuts,"hopefully this isn‚Äôt an annoying question, but i was wondering if there is any way to pay for just a cup of a flavor shot and maybe some ice? like i‚Äôm talking the standard 4 pumps in a large size iced cup filled to the top with ice. 

the reason i‚Äôm asking is because i haven‚Äôt found a suitable option for blueberry syrup that isn‚Äôt sweet. and i prefer my own homemade iced coffee and cold brew a lot better than most places. if anyone could help me out, that would be great!",question for dunkin employees

1479,DunkinDonuts,"just trying to get a free coffee with the dd members perk but apparently this location only accepts dunkin' card payments. which, okay, whatever, except, i found out that a dunkin card is a prepaid card, so in order to make this one purchase i have to preload money onto a card first (minimum $5, which isn't a lot, but i was really only planning on getting a donut).

i would choose the next location, but it also only accepts dunkin' card. as well as the next 10 locations. the 11th location only doesn't force you to pay by dunkin card because... it doesn't do online ordering.

1506,DunkinDonuts,"this drives me nuts. i have now seen this multiple times at different locations. full disclosure i‚Äôm a customer not an employee. i can‚Äôt imagine how much employees must hate this.

so multiple times i have seen the person in front of me in the drive thru ask the crew member to list every donut they offer. at some stores, this is a considerable number or varieties. my question is who in their right mind asks something like that in the drive-thru.  what an enormous waste of time. you have to be someone who‚Äôs never worked in the fast food industry to think that‚Äôs okay. they already list the most popular ones on the drive-thru menu. if you need to see more then go inside. fuck these people. know what you want or go inside. that‚Äôs it. rant over. 

p.s. thank you to all you dunkin‚Äô workers keeping us going all the time. dunkin‚Äô is my sick addiction and most days the crew person manning the drive thru is the first human being i see that day. i‚Äôve worked in fast food before and i know how thankless it can be. anyways, i appreciate you.",‚Äúlist every donut you offer‚Äù
1507,DunkinDonuts,"let it be known this was an actual interaction today. for most of the year i was getting apple crumb. today, they said they do not sell it anymore. okay, how about blueberry? they don‚Äôt sell it during fall. hmm‚Ä¶ how about boston cream? ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt have that either‚Äù. french cruller? vanilla creme? ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt carry those either‚Äù apple cider? ‚Äúwe‚Äôre out‚Äù. jeez what about chocolate cake? ‚Äúthat we do have‚Äù. if they had said no to that i would i‚Äôve asked them to surprise me to end the misery for everyone. but to be honest i don‚Äôt like every donut so if i have to be surprised, it isn‚Äôt worth the money nor calories. i understand shortages and being short staffed and all that so i do not fault the employees. but how can my local location‚Äôs options be so slim? like why is the owner or whoever removing so many options? i also posted on here a few weeks ago about how dunkin‚Äô really should make the app reflect what is in stock at the location you at ordering from like starbucks does. at this point, it‚Äôs not even worth ordering a donut because the app shows a lot of options and half of them are not sold there or are out. i‚Äôve been a loyal dunkin fan for so long and always defended it to starbucks fans but honestly‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a starbucks at my campus now and i‚Äôm having a far more positive experience there :(",so like‚Ä¶ what donuts do they carry?
1508,DunkinDonuts,mcdonalds and local coffee shops are always offering deals through the app. dunkin fails in this regard. starbucks imo suffers from a similar issue. i don‚Äôt care about ‚Äúdouble points‚Äù bs. i just want you to say a dollar off coffee or something. it‚Äôs really not that hard.,lack of deals is so annoying
1509,DunkinDonuts,"hi, this is probably a stupid question but:  i'm looking at the nutrition pdf on the dunkin' donuts website and i see that for a  pumpkin swirl iced coffee with black - small there are 110 calories. i get mine with almond milk, soo i should just add the extra like 60 calories for that, and that will give me a total calorie count, yes?",nutrition facts question

a different location told me that they'd only list 1 oat milk on the order &amp; put the regular amount in so i didn't get charged for each one. are they just ringing this in wrong? is it standard for the charge to be per milk serving? i haven't had this issue at other locations.",charges for non-dairy milk?

 when i asked about it, the employee said ""taxes are crazy"" i said ""it's not taxes, its ringing up the wrong price"" and she said the menu was wrong. didn't try to fix it or anything, just stared at me and told me the register prices dont match the menu. that's theft in my mind.

this is the second time this has happened in the last month. the first time, the advertised price was only if you purchased through the app, fine print. again, staff was totally apathetic. the drink was nasty too and they didnt offer to remake it, just stared at us hoping we would leave.

1532,DunkinDonuts,"i get that their only 99cent, but our ovens only can only cook 6 orders a time, any other weird bulk count makes them undercooked or overcooked, so it‚Äôs very annoying when customers order 3+ orders of hash browns, especially when cars behind you want them as well and it‚Äôs already hard enough as it is to keep one oven available at any given time (we only have 2 and it‚Äôs one person)

yea we could pull you, but in the 2 whole minutes it takes to make a new batch, 15-20 different food items can be ordered (no exaggeration i‚Äôm being generous here) it just destroys the whole flow of everything when we‚Äôre expected to get your order out in less then 150 seconds from when you start your order until you pay

so... i know everywhere is short staffed and dunkin employees are not exactly making bank. for that reason i really want to avoid coming off like a b*tch or karen, because i know food service is hard and aggravating, i've been there....  what's the best way to either get a refund or drink remade? 

it's becoming super common that i'll wait 20 mins in a drive thru only to find out my drink was either made wrong, or made with stale / old coffee (super obvious taste when i order the same exact drink every day of my life üòÇ) 

many of the locations near me dont have their dining room even open at the moment, again likely due to staffing, so waiting another 20 mins just seems not worth it. i wind up throwing away the drink. 

it sucks because over time, i'm throwing away a decent chunk of change because i cant stand bitter coffee (when they don't add my caramel) , or stale coffee taste. 
today i went to two locations and both made them wrong. (one was stale, the other added granulated sugar when i didnt ask for it, way too sweet).

1554,DunkinDonuts,"over the past couple years, i've lived in two different cities. i'm a starbucks regular, but go to dunkin ~2x a week for an extra cup. in both cities, i've gotten dozens of free drinks from dunkin baristas in the drive thru for seemingly no reason. i'm not using the app or making any real effort to have a conversation. i just order my drink and use my please &amp; thank you's. def not complaining, but any reason this might be lol?",free drinks for nice customers?
1555,DunkinDonuts,"i don't know about other dunkin locations, i only have 1 in my town but any free drink i'm convinced the manager tells the employees free drinks get no coffee or swirl in them. they have that free monday coffee and i only got it a few times because i've had to dump all of them except 1 and it wasn't because it was good, it just actually had coffee in it, bad coffee but still coffee. same with all my reward drinks i think i've pretty much trashed almost all of them because they were undrinkable and if i did manage to drink one it was never the standard quality. 

not that paying for drinks is much better. this location will almost never put a full amount of swirl in most drinks and there is no way employees don't know to put 3 swirls in the medium when its right there on the sticker and it's been so consistently like this for a long time that i just accept it and enjoy the flavor of the coffee instead. i usually get the cold brew which had been consistently good since it came out but has gotten weaker recently nut was still good enough to drink until they straight up gave a cup of water last time with, of course, no swirl. i don't know how they got it to turn brown when i could literally taste the flavor of the water.

my point is don't be lured in by free drink rewards and offers and waste money like i did. i wish they wouldn't even have them maybe they don't have enough product to keep up with offering free drinks. i was going to stop going a while ago but i get hooked back in when they come out with a new drink and i know if i go the first day or week it comes out they will make it properly and it's really delicious and i like the seasonal flavors they come out with that i can't make at home. which is why i need them to stop these phoney promotions and just have customers pay enough for the store to make a drink properly. 

i have written feedback through the app months ago about this problem and nothing ever changed. last time i did receive a receipt, i think maybe by accident since it was wet and stuck to the cup but i realized that was the first time i ever got a receipt from them and they have a survey on it, now i know why i've never been asked or given a receipt. and yes i filled it out. 

also i tried switching to sbux but came back to dunkin cause i just can't get into their coffee but they always seem to do a nice job making it and i appreciate the effort.",don't be fooled by dunkins free drinks

1601,DunkinDonuts,"just curious as i've never seen another dunkin do this. my local one opens at 6am and you can go inside and make an order. 

the thing is, you have to go inside if it's before 7am. they don't have online ordering for the first hour of their day and you can't make mobile orders. like, they don't turn on the machine or something. the app says ""this location is closed and will reopen at 7am"" when i can walk into the store at say, 6:15 and get my coffee. they have scattered donuts at that time. never ordered hot food though.

is there any other stores that do this? just wanted to ask. my friend says it's so they can get their baked goods ready. i'm thinking it's so they don't have to go to the store at 5am but can start getting things ready at 6am to save themselves an hour in the morning for sleep or something.",is my dunkin allowed to do this?

1607,DunkinDonuts,"so today was a first for me. today at around 5:45/6pm eastern time my fianc√© and i went through our usual dunkin drive thru and as we pull up there is a dude just standing at the drive thru order screen - not in a vehicle of any kind. he was looking at the menu but it didn't look like he was talking to the barista. after a few seconds he acknowledges us and looks like he's saying something so i rolled the window down and asked what he said. he asks me if i could pull up further because ""they don't see me out here so they don't know i'm here trying to order"". so i told him i didn't think they would serve him on foot at the drive thru. he said he couldn't go in because the lobby was closed and he couldn't fit his car in the drive thru. he points to his gigantic truck that he's towing another truck on top of. so then the barista tells him he can't be in the drive thru without a vehicle and they weren't going to be taking his order like that. well after he goes back and forth with her for a minute he finally walks off. so we pull up, order and then pull up to the window. while we were waiting for our order the barista apologized for what happened and i said it was fine and that i even told the guy they probably wouldn't serve him. so she goes ""he did the same thing yesterday and we told him he couldn't!!"" 

then another barista goes ""omg he's pulling that huge truck into the drive thru!!"" and sure enough this dude is trying to fit his behemoth vehicle into this tight little drive thru that has a pretty narrow, sharp turn on it to get to the window. and we were all saying the same thing - he's never gonna be able to make that turn!! we were laughing so i told the girl at the window that we would probably be back through tomorrow and was hoping to get an update on how the situation turned out. he was getting stuck and it looked like he got hung up on the curb as i was pulling away. i have no idea if he made the turn or not, how long it took if he did, or if he damaged their building in any way. i am so curious to find out haha i couldn't believe that! dude must have really wanted some dunkin bad!!","pittsburgh, pa pleasant hills dunkin &amp; the guy on foot in the drive thru"
1608,DunkinDonuts,"i just got a team member job at a local dunkin. this is my first food service job; previously i've worked office jobs. i took this job because i wanted to try something different. i'm especially interested in getting experience as a barista.

i've worked there ten days and i'm getting more and more frustrated. on my first day, they stuck me at the drive thru window, and that's almost all i've done since. i've learned how to make a few drinks by osmosis. i've also taught myself to use the pos order entry system at the front desk. but the only thing i've received training on is drive thru. and it's incredibly frustrating because not only have i not been trained on anything since day 1, it's like i'm also being discouraged from doing and learning new things. when i try to step up when we're ten orders behind and there's a twenty-minute queue, i'm told to go back to the drive thru and twiddle my thumbs on the off-chance the customer needs something. when it's slow and i ask my coworkers and shift leads whether there's anything i can help out with or be trained on, i'm told to just worry about drive thru. and the gm, despite telling me when i was hired that i'd be getting a ""real"" training in the first few days of work, still hasn't followed through on that. on the contrary, it's more of the same when i approach him directly: stay at the drive thru window. i don't understand and feel resentful because a) it's not like i can't handle more. i get drive thru. it's easy. b) it's not like i'm not a good worker in general. i finish all of my tasks, i take initiative to learn new things and solve problems i run into independently, and i come in on time or early and often stay late to help out. sometimes very late. c) everyone else was trained to do everything starting on their first day. people who started working there only a few days ahead of me were trained to work multiple stations and get to float around doing different jobs. i'm the only exception. wtf. 

in general, i'm not impressed with management. my gm is a nice guy and he works hard, but he's not very organized or communicative. much like i haven't been trained on many work tasks, i've also had to follow up with him multiple times on various administrative things: onboarding paperwork, what my pay actually is, whether he's looking for part time or full time employment with me, how to check my schedule (i actually learned through a coworker about our location's groupme chat where this info is posted. it then took my gm multiple tries to successfully invite me, even with me standing next to him and giving him my phone #), how to clock in and out, getting tips (which he's been late on once already), etc. he still hasn't sent me the rest of the training videos i'm supposed to do. in addition, we are chronically understaffed, which leads to extremely long wait times for our customers and lots of stress on my coworkers. (and again, despite this, apparently they don't want me to help out when there's a backlog?? i don't understand.)

is this normal? i'm seriously considering jumping ship already, but at the same time it's only been ten days and maybe it will get better...?",getting frustrated as a new hire - is this normal?

i usually get the 2 for $2 egg and cheese wake up wraps if i'm hungry. recently, two of my local dunkin spots must have made anything with cheese extra. one location charges $1.20 for a slice of cheese and another location 55 cents. so the 2 for $2 turns into 2 for $4.40 because its the $2 plus the $1.20 for each cheese. it makes absolutely no sense. is this a store decision or is it maybe a glitch in the system?

similarly, i used to have the cost of almond/oat milk covered in my free drink coupons but now i have to pay for that.

there are other locations (i'm in nyc btw) that i haven't had this issue with, but the two closest to my apartment are doing this and now i don't want to order food to pay that much.

1656,DunkinDonuts,"my first day at dunkin donuts was yesterday. i was hired for the ""baker"" position. when i went in on my forest squeduled day, they instead immediately put me on drive through, which i'd never done before. i think there was one other new girl. they taught me how to make one of the regular coffees, but it's was super busy and chaotic and i ended up standing around waiting for someone to teach me the drinks. 
manager came out and asked me to sweep the floors and wash the tables which is a bad sign, and then told me i could just go home. all within two hours.

1658,DunkinDonuts,"i left dunkin in june, but something that totally perplexed me was the price of the individual munchkins. we had a system that could ring them up individually, and each one was 15 cents. for comparison, at my store, a 25 pack was $7.13 after tax. the math obviously doesn't check out. if you rung up a 25ct as 25 individual munchkins instead of a 25 box, it would be $3.75. does anyone know what the story is with this? it's probably an oversight, but i haven't been able to get this out of my head since. and even if your store's computer system can't ring up individual munchkins, what is the price of the smallest denomination of munchkins you can ring up, and how does that stack up against the 25 (or 50, 100) counts?",for the stores that can ring up individual munchkins: are your individual munchkins cheaper than the boxes?

1665,DunkinDonuts,"hi all,  


is it bad etiquette to submit a mobile order while waiting in line at the drive thru?  


let met explain by sharing my recent experience.   


this morning, i submitted a mobile order (two lattes and half a dozen donuts) while waiting in line at the drive thru. this location was not busy, but i typically do this for a few reasons, and i thought it was more convenient on both sides. i was even under the impression that the drive thru mobile orders were not prepared until you reached the speaker regardless.  


anyways, a moment later i reach the speaker and say that i just submitted an online order. the employee was clearly frustrated and said that i can't just submit an order and immediately pick up at the drive thru. and that i need to give time for the order to be prepared. i tried to explain that i was not expecting the order to already be prepared, but i doubt i made that point clear. sensing further frustration,  i tried to just cancel the order but they said it was too late, it was already started. i relented, said thanks, and when i reached the pickup window i was greeted by a friendlier employee and the order was immediately ready.  


what happened?   


i think the first employee was having an off day, but it raises the question, is placing a mobile order while waiting in the drive thru bad etiquette?   


i do this frequently, albeit at a different location, without issue. but maybe this was the first time an employee was willing to share this feedback. should i just wait until i reach the speaker to place an order?  


i would greatly appreciate an outside perspective.  


thank you.",etiquette of placing mobile order inline at drive thru?
1666,DunkinDonuts,i had bought the pumpkin cold foam cold brew earlier. and i was confused at first why i didn't like it. because i usually buy the other cold foam drink all the time. then it hit me that i didn't add any milk to it. so the coffee flavor was hitting way more than normal. i'm going to have to do a retry and see how it goes next time. also does anybody else have when they give you a cold foam drink in the cup made for iced lattes instead of the sippy top that's made for the cold foam? definitely makes it less enjoyable because now you have to drink it with a straw.,definitely need some milk in the mix
1667,DunkinDonuts,"so i love dunkin and i almost get it every day.

i know this is going to trigger a lot of people but i don‚Äôt really like the pumpkin swirl on the ice coffee.

1709,DunkinDonuts,"hope this is ok to post there - but as a fellow dunkin' frequenter thought i'd share how i save some $$ on my daily purchases..

i use this app ""fluz"" --&gt;  [https://joinfluz.app.link/osullivan28497a66](https://joinfluz.app.link/osullivan28497a66) mainly for the benefit of generating credit card points through gift card purchases, but that's another topic :)

where it comes in handy for dunkin is that they have a select few stores (including dunkin) that give you back 35% in savings when you purchase a gift card through them ($3.5 max each voucher). so i purchase a dunkin card for $10 and the app awards me back $3.5 for that purchase. 

you get $5 in rewards when you sign up i believe, 3 free vouchers to start with when you use the above link to sign up +3 other free ones every month, just by making posts on their community message boards. so all in all, it's pretty easy to get at least a few of these monthly for savings over time..

at the risk of sounding like a robot/salesman, i'll stop here! but the app is a pretty cool source of savings if you're into that kind of min/maxing stuff - feel free to pm me for more info, if needed.

hope someone is able to find this useful, enjoy!",little tip for big dunkin' savings :)

1763,DunkinDonuts,"here's how the game works if you haven't played it yet via dunkin carnival (dunkincarnival.com).

there's three rows of dunkin products attached to balloons, you pick any from numbered #1 to 3 and mash a button that sprays a water gun and fills up the balloon. you battle against bot players that will fill the opposing balloons. first balloon to fill up and pop the balloon wins.

but the problem is, the balloon pops at random chance, not how much effort you put into the game. truth be told, the game already selects if you're a winner or not. if you're selected as a loser, it doesn't matter if you mash your mouse or tap your screen to hell, the balloon will lock at it's fullest state and not pop, leaving the other bot players to win.

but if you don't play hard enough it seems like you lost because you didn't put in enough effort, which is also false.

in my opinion the interactive 'gameplay' element should be removed before it causes frustration. you should pick a number, click it, then it plays an animation of you filling up the balloon and the other bot players beating you if you lose, the balloon popping first if you win. not you mashing buttons to see that the balloon refuses to pop no matter what and seeing a big ""haha, that effort was for nothing, take the l, loser"" in your face.","dunkin's latest carnival game on the site, balloon pop, is very misleading and can be potentially upsetting"

1798,DunkinDonuts,"let me preface by saying i hate working here haha but i needed money and this job was the only one available that worked with my schedule. having said that, my feelings are going to be biased negatively. 

recently we had a health inspector come and basically tell management that everything is wrong. and it is. no labels anywhere, sinks are gross, the drain pipes are barely cleaned and our ac is busted so it's unsavory work conditions. my managers also like to fuck off at 11am when the rush is over so they weren't present when the inspector came which was noted. 

my management is also notorious for shorting everyone their hours and not paying what people have worked. they also like to change prices on the menu frequently and blame it on corporate when other dunkin location prices in the area are cheaper (is a large iced latte supposed to be $6?). they're also so obsessed with the timer and pull up all the cars making workers run out with orders but no one to stay inside to make quick coffees. i want to tell all the customers that come to this location, especially the regulars, that this dunkin is no good and their money is better spent somewhere else. 

they also like to never make the sunrise and midnight hot coffees and instead just put an espresso shot to ""cut costs"". when they leave my coworkers and i will always make fresh batches of both. none of what they do makes sense to me and i'm looking forward to the day they get shut down.

1856,DunkinDonuts,"i'm one of those crazy people that has chosen to go low carb and have been doing it for 3+ years with tremendous success and lately have been enjoying some dunkin and want to learn about the almond and coconut milks being used.

first question is almond breeze and silk are the brands as far as i know,  are they sweetened? 

i am looking at the nutritional information on that dunkin releases and i can see the following:

large iced coffee with coconut milk is 20 calories and 1 total carbs - this would lead me to believe that the coconut milk is not sweetened.

large hot coffee with almond milk is 35 calories and 5 total carbs with 5 grams of added sugar. (sweetened maybe)? calories a little low for the sweetened version but that maybe the amount of almond milk used.

large vanilla iced macchiato with almond milk is 100 calories 16 total carbs with 13 added sugar. this speaks that the vanilla almond milk is sweetened or there is sweet vanilla syrup added.

if anyone works at dunkin could you please take a picture of the box and the nutrition facts - i would love to make my own informed decision on what i can indulge. also if you can answer the question that would be awesome. thank you in advance!",question about almond and coconut milks at dunkin

thank you!","cups, mugs and everything in-between"
1923,DunkinDonuts,planning to treat myself with the reward tomorrow. i would prefer an iced drink that is coffee and typically i like semi sweet (maybe 1 or 2 swirls less than standard). any creative flavor mixtures?,free drink reward ideas?
1924,DunkinDonuts,"a few weeks ago i went to several dunkin‚Äô locations and were told they were out of strawberry for any refreshers. today, i go to another dunkin location and am told they were completely out of all refreshers. so i couldn‚Äôt even get a substitute flavor. i asked if they planned to restock soon and i didn‚Äôt really get an answer. i am located in connecticut. is anyone else having this problem in their state? i grew to quickly love the refreshers when i first had one in may and it‚Äôs just really frustrating that now i am  unable to purchase any flavor.",are all the refreshers discontinued?

1928,DunkinDonuts,"the timer is apparently number 1 priority.  i dont see how they expect me and my crewmates to be keeping the timer under a certain amount and still want us pumping food out to the customer without parking them.

1932,DunkinDonuts,"so now that the pandemic is hopefully almost over, and most of us have come out wiser, hardened , and with a lower faith in humanity, do any of you guys have any good pandemic stories?
i‚Äôll go first, so around january when masks were still required and covid was more rampant than ever we had this guy walk in without a mask on. so during that time we were being told that masks were a requirement and to not take any orders from people that weren‚Äôt wearing masks, and that if we did we would get a warning and a write up. so we told the guy very calmly ‚Äúi‚Äôm sorry sir but do you have a mask? we aren‚Äôt able to take your order if you don‚Äôt have one since it‚Äôs a store policy‚Äù, at the time it wasn‚Äôt just a store policy but a state executive order so it wasn‚Äôt out of the norm to say that, let me tell you this guy‚Äôs demeanor did a complete 180, he started cussing us out, screaming that we were infringing on his personal freedom and that we were being brainwashed by the media and how it was all fake, and when we refused to budge he then demanded to know all of our names and how he was going to report us and a whole bunch of stuff, at the end we had to threaten to call the police so he would leave, the poor girl who initially took his order quit after that since that hadn‚Äôt been the first time that this had happened. after that whenever people would start to yell and demand our names we would start messing around and giving fake names, people started to give suggestions over the head-sets, my favorite suggestions were laquisha, tyquan, becky, candy, brad, sugar, and a whole much of stuff.

1938,DunkinDonuts,"so i had a free drink on my dd app. i noticed they have been advertising the coconut milk latte for 5.75 so i thought i‚Äôd get that.

i ordered it. use my free code and i had to pay 1.10 extra. i asked why? she says dollar extra coconut milk . oh yes of course. so i paid. 

ten seconds later i looked on my receipt. she placed my order as a regular latte with 1.00 extra coconut milk. 

i showed her that , explained coconut milk latte is its own order. if i order a latte with a side of coconut milk , i would totally understand, but the store is advertising coconut milk latte for 575 so why would that not be the free drink. she said again that they add an extra dollar for the coconut milk and latte is 4.75. i said ok and just left.

1942,DunkinDonuts,"for anyone who tried it, what drink did you put it in?

i got mine with the lemonade which is their poster rec. the bubbles in large quantities taste like cherry flavored cough syrup to me. i diluted the entire drink with spindrift pink lemonade seltzer so it was drinkable but overall i would skip this order. if you want good popping bubbles, i'd go to a bubble tea shop since you can customize the tea, flavor, and sweetness as well as the flavor of the bubbles.",thoughts on the strawberry popping bubbles?
1943,DunkinDonuts,"i tried to get the pink strawberry coconutmilk refresher today from one of my dunkins, they said it‚Äôs discontinued. i tried to let them know that they should probably fix the signage outside because it‚Äôs a little confusing ‚Äî def sounded like a karen, really meant it as a recommendation since it is deceptive. 

then i tried strawberry lemonade, which they said is also discontinued. considering i saw signs out front and in the store advertising strawberry lemonade i was kinda confused. finally, the manager who was increasingly frustrated with me, was like ‚Äúthe best i can give you is lemonade with strawberry bubbles,‚Äù which she did, and then they said they don‚Äôt have boba straws. so basically i didn‚Äôt even get to have any bubbles.

i work retail and i know how irritating customers can be, but honestly the whole thing was just so strange to. it‚Äôs so strange that an entire set of drinks being advertised in-store and available on the app are gone ‚Äî was this just a weird location or is it actually discontinued?",is everything strawberry discontinued?

1956,DunkinDonuts,a lot of drinks i usually order like say the iced chai or matcha. there's usually either matcha stuck to the bottom or  syrup that hadn't been mixed in right. and it usually messes up the completeness of the drink. i had to try starbucks versions to see if this is just a common thing. and come to find out it's really just a dunkin thing. because i just bought an iced chai form starbucks and had a matcha the other day. and no remnants of syrup or anything at the bottom. just perfectly mixed and blended. doesn't starbucks use things like syrup and power as well?,why are starbucks drinks more blended properly compare to dunkin?
1957,DunkinDonuts,the one time i ordered the guy was completely clueless. what makes it worse he probably was the manager too. but he gave me a regular cold foam with no smoke vanilla syrup. the other time i ordered from a different place but it was just the smoked vanilla iced latte. and that time i got to taste what the smoked vanilla actually tasted like and it was enjoyable. but i'm going to try a different location because that first spot i go to the guy always messes up most of the time. and it's not even no point in telling him to make it over. because he doesn't even know the new drinks. and it stressed me out trying to explain something he should already know. but it's supposed to the powder sprinkle on top as well right?,for the smoke vanilla with cold cream. are they suppose to sprinkle some powder on top? like they have in the photos

1962,DunkinDonuts,"\*disclaimer: i can only speak for my store, and anything i will say is not necessarily representative of other stores\*

my store has a drive thru, and just about every day there is always a mad rush within the last 10 minutes before we close, with the line spilling out onto the street. our store works best when there are 4 or 5 crewmembers working the closing shift, though due to staffing shortages we have been running on 3 people (the bare minimum: 1 person each on drive thru order/register, beverages, sandwich). because we have 2 stations, drive thru and the walk-in/front lobby, we have two stations to clean up and it is a lot of work for 3 people. about 30 minutes before closing we begin to discard most of our stock, so we usually only have enough coffee (both hot and iced),as well as iced and green tea for 4 or 5 larges of each. we have also begun the process of closing down by then, and all of the machines are fully stocked and cleaned. it is difficult and annoying to have to set something up for one customer, only to take it down again. if we don't do this, we are stuck cleaning for well over an hour after closing which nobody wants to do after 9-10 hour shifts. unless all you're getting is a simple drink or two, please make every effort to come in earlier. 

&amp;#x200b;

tl;dr:

please make every effort to not order within the last half hour of closing of any dd store, because it disrupts the closing process, and our inventory/stock is more limited by then. come in earlier, and it will be easier for us to fulfill any orders which benefits both the customer and crew.  for example, if a store closes at 8pm, try to order by 7:30. we really appreciate it :)","psa: please please make every effort not to order within the last hour, come in earlier if possible"

2007,DunkinDonuts,"had cookie dough swirl for the past 3 days, different style of coffee every time.

cold brew, cappuccino, and regular iced coffee (considering trying sunrise batch + cd).

it tastes like those homemade edible cookie dough bites or those candy cookie dough bites in theaters and groceries. in my opinion, it's not going to top butter pecan for me but it is very nice and refreshing to have. i do like mixing things up so i won't get sick of bp and this swirl will do nicely.

it's seems pretty mildly flavored for a swirl. the flavor of espresso greatly compliments but fights the cookie dough flavor, i'd prefer it but i may consider a pump extra. while with weaker coffee such as brew (iced/hot), the cookie dough flavor should be more obvious. even then, try it with regular pumps and see if you want a pump extra.",cookie dough swirl thoughts
2008,DunkinDonuts,"hi guys, i'm a new employee at dunkin' donuts (started last monday) before dd, i worked at a locally owned cafe shop where i received professional barista training and i also worked at starbucks, so needless to say i'm pretty familiar with making espresso drinks. i started working at dd for a summer job and because it was within walking distance to where i live.

starbucks has a very specific system when it comes to making espresso drinks, the shots are pulled to order. the tall gets one shot, and the grande and venti get two shots unless the customer asked for extra. then, add the syrups and then fill the milk or water. if it is an iced drink, they fill the milk to the line indicated on the cup, and then the rest is filled with ice, it's a pretty easy, straightforward system to learn.

however, at dd, there seems to be no rhythm or reason to how these drinks are made. my manager fills a pitcher full of espresso shots and just leaves it sitting there all day, which in my opinion, is gross. nobody has any clue how many shots each drink is supposed to be getting and i witness my managers putting an enormous amount of espresso in drinks all the time. it honestly makes me worry about the customer's health. i also noticed at dd, the iced cups have lines and numbers inside of them as well, which leads me to believe that they are supposed to be made in a manner similar to starbucks where the ice is added last, but if i don't add the ice first, the manager gets ticked. i don't understand adding the ice first at all, when you are pouring the iced coffee, tea, etc all it does is bounce off the ice and make a huge mess. the syrups cannot get mixed correctly like this either

nobody here understands the art of steaming milk correctly. listening to the steam pitcher make that horrible ringing sound is the worst thing in the world. none of my coworkers seem to get that the milk steamer should not be making that sound and when i say anything about it all i get is ""well that's how it is.""

so please tell me is this normal?? because i really feel like it isn't. anytime i ask questions about this all i get is ""well, this is how i was trained.""",is this normal? or is the store i am working at just weird? (espresso drinks)

2031,DunkinDonuts,"hopefully this goes through this time.

i started working at my dunkin' a week or two after i turned 18. (i am 19 now so it has been a full year.) i was the youngest worker in the store and honestly, my co-workers treated me differently because of it.

to start off, i applied to work part time, and i told the owner and manager that during my interview. since i was 18 i was supposed to start college soon. well some paperwork issues happened with my college and i didnt get to start until almost november. dunkin' saw this free time i had as an opportunity and scheduled me for more than 40 hours a week, for almost a month. however my checks would read 38 or 39 hours and i always assumed i was counting wrong. (turns out they dropped my hours so i wouldn't get benefits since i was technically part-time).

the employees there treated me like a running man. even though i was trained in every station and could work it effectively, i was never assigned a station in the morning, i was just expected to run around and help any station that was overwhelmed. i was fine with this, until employees would start yelling at me because they needed help and i was somewhere else. one employee in particular expected me to drop everything i was doing the second they called me, even if i was actively talking to a customer.  

because i was expected to be everywhere at once, i was never allowed to sit down or even lean against the counter. after the rush ended i was expected to stock up or wipe everything meticulously, my manager's signature catchphrase was ""if you got time to lean you got time to clean"" yet you'd always see him leaning/sitting down. i had to use my bathroom breaks to get a chance to lean and take a breather. but that didnt stop anyway from yelling at me from behind the counter to hurry up because people were in line.

i could never use my phone, even if i was in the back with no customers in the lobby. someone would always say something like ""go stock xyz"" or ""yknow the boss is watching on the cameras"" despite the fact that some employees would actively be on a phone call during the morning rush. i never sat on social media at work either, it was usually to text my parents about when i was getting home and if i needed a ride.

the last time i complained about how i felt disrespected while working there, the manager told me word for word that i was imagining it and ""maybe i had some problems at home that i needed to work on."" honestly that should've been the biggest red flag but it was my first job and i always told myself that maybe i was being dramatic and all jobs were like this.

maybe i am still being a bit dramatic, but even if i am i don't care anymore. the job made me feel terrible and theres always others, that will hopefully treat me better.","lets try this again, i quit my dunkin because it was a nightmare"

2076,DunkinDonuts,"first, start with the size you want. small, medium or large, (or extra large for hot drinks). then, specify what drink you want. ‚Äúhot latte‚Äù or ‚Äúiced coffee‚Äù for example. then, say what you want in it (sugars, creams, milks, flavor shots and swirls, etc.)

i know it may not seem that hard, but the pos requires us to choose size first, then what kind of drink before we can modify it. it‚Äôs hard when a customer comes in saying ‚Äúi want a hot hazelnut with 2 sugars.‚Äù what size? a hot hazelnut what? a latte? a coffee? or it‚Äôs even worse when the customer says ‚Äúcan i get 2 pumps of french vanilla, 1 and a half caramel, whipped cream and drizzle?‚Äù like you‚Äôre just going to have to repeat your modifiers because i don‚Äôt even know what drink it is that you want, i don‚Äôt know the size or anything. then customers get mad when you ask to repeat yourself. please just be respectful, we‚Äôre people too :)

(also, another tip, don‚Äôt order signature lattes, they‚Äôre more expensive than regular lattes. if you want a caramel craze and want to save a couple cents, just say you want a caramel iced latte with cinnamon sugar and whipped cream. it‚Äôs cheaper. same with the butter pecan sundae, order a butter pecan iced latte with sprinkles and whipped cream with caramel drizzle!)

i‚Äôm also going to add one more thing. when you‚Äôre ordering, be patient please. don‚Äôt list 5 different very specific drinks back to back without giving us the time to input them and make sure they‚Äôre correct on the pos. let your cashier ask what else you would like when they‚Äôre done with the first drink. especially to the new workers, the pos can be confusing and difficult to navigate, so some patience with us is nice. if you‚Äôre ordering for a group at work or for friends and have the drinks or food written down on a paper or in a text, you can just show us instead of reading it over and over again, it‚Äôs actually a little easier (imo) to see what drink someone wants written down instead of hearing it.

2147,DunkinDonuts,"a lot of weird things happened during my 45 minute drive through experience today but the strangest part that i cannot explain was the actual donut i ordered. i later have deduced that the printer was broken and that made the line long and the encounter awkward. but seriously how does this happen to a donut? i wish i would have taken a picture...

 i always get a jelly donut. i know it is raspberry flavored apple jelly inside. it wasn't today!  it had what tasted like straight strawberry smuckers jam in it... i cant decide if they ran out of jelly donuts and made their own with store bought jelly, or if they got donuts from the local place down the street.... it was so weird. the jelly was way too sweet and wet and leaked through the other ends (top and bottom not side where they smoosh it in). plus the flavor, texture, everything was off!

such an odd experience. i can explain away the wait time, messed up drink, poor communication by, what i assume, was the printer being down, but how about the strange donut filling????

2150,DunkinDonuts,"so i know there has been a lot of negatively charged reviews on the refreshers, but i tried two of them and they really weren‚Äôt that bad! 

i tried the strawberry dragon fruit and peach passion fruit. 

to me, the strawberry one tasted almost identical to starbucks‚Äô pink drink. however, i am not a huge fan of the the pink drink. i think the only distinguishing part was the aftertaste of dunkin‚Äôs drink, it tasted almost like bubblegum. i can see how someone would say it tasted medicine like but i think that‚Äôs a slight exaggeration. overall i rate this one a 7/10, not bad but wouldn‚Äôt order again. 

for the peach passion fruit drink, i had low expectations for this one, but it ended up being my favorite! it‚Äôs so good! i was pleasantly surprised. the flavor was light and not too overpowering. i would rate this one a 9/10. i‚Äôm just worried because i feel like dunkin‚Äô drinks are never made consistently so i don‚Äôt want to get this drink again and end up not liking it.

so when i ordered today i asked for extra cold foam and they said they can‚Äôt do that. i asked if they could just put less coffee and more foam on top? they said they can‚Äôt because it‚Äôs ‚Äúmeasured‚Äù. i don‚Äôt understand? from what i‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs pretty much a spray can? so they really can‚Äôt just put less coffee and spray more on top? i don‚Äôt even mind if it‚Äôs roughly eyed up. just wondering how this works and how this drink is actually made. 

i‚Äôve just been really disappointed in dunk lately. this coffee would taste so much better with a bit more foam to sweeten the taste. i don‚Äôt like to add other sugars or syrups and i like the flavor of the cold foam itself a lot. just a vanilla cold brew with extra foam is all i want. :( maybe i need to figure out how to make something like this myself at home? there‚Äôs got a to be a way. if starbucks can fill like half a cup with foam in their ‚Äúcloud‚Äù drink i don‚Äôt know why dunk can‚Äôt give me more than a half inch? i‚Äôm not mad or anything, just sad and i don‚Äôt understand lol. any advice or explanation would be appreciated so i can understand better. thanks i‚Äôm advance!",never enough cold foam.

2175,DunkinDonuts,did anyone else like the pistachio flavor when it was around? i've been waiting for it and there's no signs of it returning. i don't understand why either. it was a top seller at 4 dunkins near me. i was so hooked on it. i didn't care for when they mixed it with chocolate but at this point i'll even take that lol. but nothing beats the original pistachio swirl. i swear it's better than most of there perminent flavors. the big question is how do we get this flavor back? petition? lol idk. i just really want to try it again.,bring back pistachio please!!!

today, i walked into a dunkin' for the first time ever (i live on the west coast)...and there it was! i could smell that same chemical/plastic taste as soon as i walked in.

2178,DunkinDonuts,"new crew member here. my location is understaffed, and i don't think i've met any official managers. this whole time i thought that my hiring manager was the one in charge because he trained me, everyone else seems to know him, and he was also the person i usually contacted for questions, but he doesn't seem to be present at our location all the time. this evening i did a google search and apparently hiring managers aren't bosses. 

the next in line of authority seems to be the shift leader, but i don't have any of their contact info and i don't think they're the people i should ask when it comes to schedule change requests and things like that? or are they?

2179,DunkinDonuts,"i go to dunkin once a week, only because i am an hour away from my location.  so when i make the drive to my weekly therapy appointment i always swing by the drive through to get an non dairy  vanilla iced coffee (kudos to the coconut milk addition) and i order a 50 count munchkins with half glazed and just put whatever else in for that half. they are inexpensive &amp; excites my kid and husband both for me to bring them home. 

today was no different but i was only  behind 3 cars in line. but it took a good 20 minutes until i got to order at the speaker. once i got to the speaker there was a sign they were out of like frozen coffee drinks and basically any specialty drinks for the day. then another sign saying they‚Äôd be closing early, assuming for the fact they were running low on everything else coffee wise.  (mind you this was like mid afternoon) 

sooooo....i ordered my regular, given the total and drove around. the poor man working the window looked so defeated, just over it all lol he hands me back my card while i was asking how his day had been going since i saw all that signage and he said it was hard more mentally than anything because how rude customers have been toward the specialty the drinks they may want, not being available. i said don‚Äôt worry and just take your time. 

y‚Äôall

he came back to the window and he handed me two of the 50count munchkins and before i could ask if i messed up and ordered 2x50 c munchkins. this little feller says ‚Äúmam these are heavy because i packed them full so i gave you 50 count of glazed with plenty extra then the other box packed full of assorted until i couldn‚Äôt hardly close the box. ‚Äú i told him thank you so much to which he said. ‚Äúi‚Äôm done... i am done with today. oh and.... here‚Äôs a dozen donuts.......just for not being a jerk.‚Äù

so... what should i say to the new manager? they're really nice and understanding, but i don't want to disappoint them or anything like that. i also love the work environment and don't want to lose it. the place i work at is also a bit understaffed and i feel really bad for leaving so abruptly, even though i sort of have to.

see the new sunrise batch is offering 3x points when you mobile order. perfect. i‚Äôll take an xl with 2 cream 2 butter pecan. send order in as i pull into the dunkin. 

drivethru is 6 cars deep, so i‚Äôll go inside. i walk in and it‚Äôs busy; 5 people in line. i head over to the mobile pick up and i‚Äôm greeted by what looks to be a manager (this detail is important later.) he finds my slip and begins making my drink. 

i get my coffee and head to my car. as i walk out i notice the coffee doesn‚Äôt feel overly warm. whatever, maybe the cup is thick today. get out to my car. take a drink. luke warm would be giving it too much credit. it was room temp. i decided to be ‚Äúthat person‚Äù and go back in...

i approach the same guy and politely said, ‚Äúi hate to do this, but this coffee is nearly cold.‚Äù

to which he replied.....wait for it....

‚Äúyeah, i was thinking it might be...‚Äù

2208,DunkinDonuts,"i feel like this is a common problem among dunkin locations, but i'm not sure.  i usually go for an iced coffee 3-4 times per week, just with cream and sugar.  what i don't understand is, for a chain that has the exact same recipe for making each drink, how the quality can be so inconsistent from day to day.

&amp;#x200b;

like this week.  i went three times this week, including today.  the other day, i got a small iced with cream and sugar.  it had just the right amount of sweetness, ice and coffee flavor, and it was great.  same thing with the caramel earlier in the week.  delicious.  then, i went again today just for another small with cream and sugar.  today's version of ""iced coffee"" was lukewarm coffee with two or three ice cubes floating on top, rather than the ice being put at the bottom, and it tasted like actual toilet water.  i actually dumped the whole thing out as soon as i got home because i had no cream and sugar in my house to make it palatable.

does anybody else experience this at their locations?  i never can understand why a chain like this is so inconsistent.  there is a location that's slightly farther from my house that is almost always good and consistent, so it doesn't happen at every single location.  but i'm failing to understand why we're paying $3-4, and it's like playing at a casino in vegas, waiting to see whether you'll get a decent cup of coffee or toilet water.  i do have anxiety, which is triggered by fully caffeinated coffee, so i tend to stick with half-caff.  i'm sure the decaf addition does play a role, but even when my anxiety was nonexistent and i got full regular, it was the same thing.",does anyone else get annoyed at how inconsistent the quality of dunkin is each day?

2243,DunkinDonuts,"butter pecan is overrated.

it‚Äôs decent, don‚Äôt get me wrong. it just seems super overhyped. it‚Äôs been around for years, and it‚Äôs incredibly sweet. the flavor is alright, it tastes similar to ice cream, but dunkin‚Äô has had many other flavors that top butter pecan. for example: banana split, white chocolate, cookie dough, peanut butter, and several others.

i do not have luck with dunkin‚Äô swirls. a lot of them have a strange aftertaste to me or something *off* about them. 

i love vanilla, but the vanilla swirl just has this odd twang at the end. the pink velvet was decent enough, but a bit too sweet.

this morning i tried 2 swirls in an xl hot coffee. pretty solid. figured i‚Äôd give it one more try. 

got a frozen coffee after work (don‚Äôt judge two trips in one day). large frozen coffee with cream and 3 swirls. wowzers. it spoke to me in a language that few can speak.

2247,DunkinDonuts,"last night i went to dunkin and it was possibly the worst customer service i‚Äôve ever had. my friend and i pull up to the drive thru, and have to wait about 3 minutes until they take our order. there were 2 other cars in front of us. we pull up from the speaker and begin waiting about 10+ minutes to even move from that spot. as we we were waiting, cars began to back out from behind us and we almost did but we decided to wait it out. we finally pull  up to the window after the guy in front of us just drives right past it because he‚Äôs so annoyed, and we get our food immediately because all we got was 2 munchkins lol. 
i look inside and only see 2 workers. one has no mask on at all and is yelling at kids in the main lobby to sit down, while the other does all the orders.
wtf. i can sympathize because they were definitely short staffed and if she had to bring her kids to work because she had no one to take care of them, but if it inhibits you from actually doing your job maybe another solution would be better.

2251,DunkinDonuts,"hi everyone :)

i  go through the drive thru and grab a coffee at my local dunkin almost every day on my way to work at around 6:20/6:30am. my dunkin's hours are listed (both on a sticker window and on the app) as opening at 5am every day.

now, multiple times, and only ever on sundays, literally no one is there... it has happened 3 times to me, and once my to brother. always on a sunday, and yes i work weekends.

so my question is, is it worth my time to call someone about this, who would you call and is there a way i could do it anonymously?  the people who are there on sundays are usually different employees i have also noticed. i'm not usually a complainer but only because this has happened multiple times, it's getting a little annoying and some days i worry they won't be open on my way to work, it's just very inconvenient. like you can't just... not show up to work when you're supposed to and continue to get away with it. anyways, thanks in advance for any comments.",local dunkin is not opening on time? should i do anything?
2252,DunkinDonuts,"i honestly love this dunkin to death. their coffee is always fresh and not burnt (another dunkin in my area has always burnt coffee, idk how), and the employees are super nice. they've only gotten my order wrong once and that was today, but they were sooo sweet about it and fixed it in no time (she just handed me the wrong order through the drive thru). the employees there always have the best attitude and are super sweet and that's that's i love most about this dunkin (they also sometimes compliment me when i get my nails done :) ). i went there one day and it started pouring hard, if i would've known that  it was going to rain hard i wouldn't have gotten a certain food item as it usually takes longer so i have to pull up into a parking spot and wait for someone to bring it out (you're not allowed to go inside due to covid). so it was raining super hard but the employee working their brought out my order in the rain and was super polite! i always make sure to tip them when i can! and that's my little dunkin appreciation rant, sorry if it was hard to read im originally from a different country and moved to the us so english is my second language",dunkin in my city

2254,DunkinDonuts,"as a longtime customer (8 years), i love dunkin‚Äô deeply. i get a large iced coffee (dark roast until discontinuation; cold brew isn‚Äôt as good as dark roast, despite the same beans, but an espresso shot does help out) with one milk and one sugar. i get black iced coffee if i‚Äôm at an artisan shop because it‚Äôs better coffee, but dunkin‚Äô is just better with a bit of milk and sugar. i don‚Äôt mind that, and dunkin‚Äô is still what i get every morning  (and not because of price point) because it‚Äôs more enjoyable to me.

so i like black coffee most of the time, but i get a lil‚Äô milk and sugar at dunkin‚Äô. that doesn‚Äôt make me a coffee failure or someone who hates coffee, anymore than it does the people who want the dunkin‚Äô-determined normal amount of milk and sugar (or cream/sugar) with some flavor pop.

we all know the normal amounts for a particular drink. three of each is standard for a medium iced, four for a large. you add in proportionate flavoring for your taste. we each like our own coffee our own way. 

but for people shaming someone getting a fairly normal drink, what‚Äôs your fucking deal? if you‚Äôre a coffee snob, go to the starbucks subreddit (as if sbucks doesn‚Äôt burn their beans and give bitter, bad coffee half the time unless you pay extra for the good beans with the clover) or to some coffee subreddit where your views will be ‚Äúappreciated.‚Äù

but dunkin‚Äô isn‚Äôt about snobbery. as the beautiful, hella accurate and lovable snl skit showed, we are not about snobbery.

2257,DunkinDonuts,"i'm not a coffee drinker. i don't like bitter things and i don't like warm beverages and i don't really like the flavor of coffee in general. however, i recently discovered the chocolate stout cold brew with cold foam and am obsessed. the calorie count and grams of sugar were relatively low (at least compared to starbucks frappuccinos which is the only other coffee beverage i like) and the chocolatey goodness masked the bitterness of the coffee, leaving a pleasant vague coffee flavor. but the drink is now discontinued and o have no idea what to do with myself! 

this post is mostly just to share my sadness about the loss of the chocolate stout cold brew in case anyone else is feeling the same... maybe dunkin management is reading and will reconsider! üòÖ

2259,DunkinDonuts,"what would you have done?

this morning, i decided i‚Äôd treat myself and try the butter pecan swirl. i ordered (in the drive thru) a small iced latte with one pump butter pecan swirl.

i get to the window and the guy hands me my receipt. it says two pumps swirl. 
‚Äúhey do you know if this was made with one or two pumps? on the receipt it says two.‚Äù
‚Äúoh yeah, that‚Äôs just the swirl! it comes with two.‚Äù
‚Äúi know, i just asked for one pump tho!‚Äù
confused...but hands me the drink and says he doesn‚Äôt know how they made it so just try it and see if i like it. it tasted great but was wayyy to sweet so i asked for the one pump. 

so i‚Äôm waiting for the drink the be remade (again, in the drive thru) and so he hands me the new one and tells me to try it again to make sure and that he had just made it for me himself. it was filled up so much with ice that i couldn‚Äôt even get the straw in. i finally did and it tasted absolutely horrible. he asked how it was. 
‚Äúi‚Äôm so sorry, but this doesn‚Äôt taste right either. it tastes really different than the first one and weak.‚Äù
‚Äúwell actually this is a latte. so it‚Äôs different than coffee. it has a milk base and one shot of espresso so it‚Äôs not going to taste as strong.‚Äù (i get that a lot of ppl probably don‚Äôt, but i know what a latte is üôÑ)
‚Äúno i know, it‚Äôs just that this hardly has any coffee flavor.‚Äù
‚Äúoh so do you want me to add another shot of espresso?‚Äù

y‚Äôall i told him it was fine and he was like i‚Äôm so sorry we‚Äôre short staffed. (this guy was super nice) he asked again if he could do something and i said no and drove off. i was already anxious about holding up the line but gahh what was i supposed to do in this situation?? since y‚Äôall are employees what do you think?

i am 99% sure that the second drink did not have a shot of espresso. but i‚Äôm not going to be a smarta** to the guy who just made my drink and tell him there‚Äôs no espresso in it. but y‚Äôall there was no espresso. especially since there was so much ice, that would‚Äôve made the milk to espresso ratio even less so even a stronger drink. and i realized the reason it even tasted like a hint of coffee was because he used the same cup from the original drink. 

i felt like a diva but at the same time my drink was made wrong twice in a row and now i‚Äôm bitter cause i drove away paying $4 for pecan flavored milk üò©

ps it took me a second to realize where i recognized the flavor but the butter pecan swirl tastes exactly like the caramel br√ªl√©e from starbucks

there's a young man around my age who works at my local dunkin; for all intents and purposes, i'll call him j. my stepdad goes to dunkin almost daily, and he gets along well with j. as a result, j will sometimes slip us a discount or something, just to be nice. today, i asked at the drive thru if the new refreshers were available yet, and the person taking our order said no. j was at the window, and my stepdad mentioned the refresher. j was confused and said they were starting to roll out the new releases today. he asked me which one i wanted, and because i didn't realize he was trying to take my order, i said, like a dumbass, ""oh, uh, i just wanted to try one."" j stepped away and returned a few minutes later with two of the new drinks. i gave him the cash i had in my wallet, but he didn't actually ring up the drinks. this kid made me two drinks bc he didn't know which one i wanted and gave them to us for free. i guess i'm sensitive or something, but i thought it was so sweet of him to do that. i want to thank him, but idk how. my usual way of showing gratitude to someone is by baking them something, but that seems really weird to me? upon thinking about this more, it seems weird that i'm thinking about this so much at all. i guess what i want to know is, 1. is this weird lol, and 2. if you are/were a dunkin employee, did you ever develop a rapport with any of your customers like this? i have anxiety and can't stop worrying about this lol. sorry for the novel, thank you if you've read this far, and thank you extra if you reply.",kinda random but dunkin-related question

2266,DunkinDonuts,i went in the other night for a simple drink. it's late night so it's no traffic in the store. so i expect this to just be in and out. i get there and first off the guy has his hood on while on the job like he's relaxing at home. and at the same time he's talking on the phone thru his earphones. but i ignore it and just tell him my drink. like i don't care if you want to be on your phone as long as you can properly multitask. it's like cab drivers that are always on their phone but that doesn't stop them from doing their job efficiently. but this dude you can clearly see is struggling to focus with the cup in his hand. i wanted one of the new cold foam drinks that comes with the new lids. he basically made an iced latte instead with whip cream and a different lid. i honestly just started heading out the door after that. because at that point you're just disrespecting the customer and i didn't want to waste my money from there on. i got  to this spot a few times every often. but usually it's an older worker there that's less distracted. like i said i don't care if you're on the phone and doing all this extra stuff you shouldn't be doing. but don't let it affect your productivity.,can workers be in their phones while in the job?
2267,DunkinDonuts,"i get it, switching away from the styrofoam cups was supposed to have environmental and health benefits. but i confess, i hate these paper cups. they don't keep my coffee warm if i'm walking in the cold weather, and they don't prevent my hands from getting burned from the coffee temperature itself when i'm handed the cup at the drove thru (they don't seem to give you a protective cardboard sleeve like starbucks). also, they tend to leak, as the lids don't stay secured very well and don't seal well at the seam - very dangerous in the car.

yes, i could bring some kind of reusable cup to solve this issue, but the whole point of dunks to me is getting the coffee on the go, when i don't have the time to make it myself or deal with carrying a travel mug around and having to clean it. like many people, i only buy dunks in the context of a travel situation, and these leaky, poorly insulated cups are just not good for that kind of context.

on a side note, dunkin' used to be significantly less expensive than starbucks, but it seems that difference is getting much smaller.  also, starbucks doesn't tell me ""we don't have dark roast, just midnight roast"" every time i ask for the dark roast, they just give me whatever dark roast they happen to have.  furthermore, i miss the cheddar cheese dunks used to put on turkey sausage breakfast sandwiches.  ok rant over.",the paper cups could use improvement

2273,DunkinDonuts,"hey so i started working at my local dunkin' about two months ago i think. i generally work close, friday through monday, and sometimes i work a little bit in the morning on thursday. so usually anywhere from 20-25 hours a week. which wouldn't be the worst, if i didn't also have school to worry about. trying to juggle my college course load and the job has been stressful to say the least. sometimes i feel like i barely have time to relax. i was basically at a 3.6 gpa last semester before having a job, and now i'm at like a 3.0 this semester.

working my normal shifts truthfully aren't that bad. if i didn't have school, it would be fine. the problem is we're short staffed and people are always calling in and asking for time off so i'm always having to cover for people and coming in early on weekends. i don't get how y'all work morning weekend rushes, i can't. i get overwhelmed when i'm over at the sandwich station, it's just a bunch of parts that move very fast and you can only heat so much stuff at once and it ducking burns. i told my boss i don't like working sandwich station at all and would prefer not to work there, yet every time i'm there in the morning, i'm plopped at sandwich station and i don't have the guts to stand up for myself and say something cause i don't wanna be seen as the person with an attitude. 

and school is over for me in a few weeks, which is nice, but that means i'll probably be getting scheduled more, which i'm not looking forward to. i feel like this job has added nothing but stress into my life and the only reason i still have it is because i desperately needed the money. i dream about quitting and i want to, because it's simply too fast and too overwhelming and too many things that need to be done and me constantly having to clean up the slack of other people. but we're short staffed as it is, i don't want to make things worse by leaving. and i got turned down from three other places before applying here, so i don't even know when i'll be able to find another job if i quit. i'm sorry for ranting and if i may come across as a crybaby, but please don't judge me until you're in my shoes. idk, i'm really conflicted. what do i do/",i kind of want to quit but i'm conflicted

2297,DunkinDonuts,"for the past couple of days, this one customer has given us so much grief. she‚Äôs threatened to throw hot coffee on us, has called corporate on our manager. and just has been completely disagreeable. all because we‚Äôve had to buckle down the last two weeks on not steaming anything other than milk (for those who don‚Äôt know if you steam anything like cream or coffee it will clog and break our machines). 

she tries everyday to get her cream steamed. i was at the register at drive thru today. and typically work drive thru most days 6am-2pm. our manager was taking orders and she completely went off on him about how she always gets her cream steamed in the morning and that he‚Äôs just never there. mind you he‚Äôs there everyday from 3am-1pm just about.

in the past month i have had 2 issues happen where i was overcharged in the app, onceni was charged 2.75 for a $2 for 10 munchkin box and then another time i ordered a drink and when i arrived they were out and come to find out i can't cancel orders after they are made. so i was offered another drink and not wanting to be a nuisance agreed to the suggestion and left, upon getting home i realized the alternative drink was $2 less than what i paid. 

now granted $2.75 the cumulative amount of money i have been overcharged is a very small amount however its the principal of the matter. each time i have written i get angela giving a very canned response that the info is being passed along to train employees and thanks for notifying them.

but the reason i ask how it‚Äôs made is some days a cup will get here filled nearly to the top with milk and there will be a maybe one inch layer of espresso maximum. other days it‚Äôs more like 60/40 milk/espresso (which is perfect). i guess sometimes it‚Äôs 50/50 as well. but more often than not it‚Äôs varying degrees of so much milk and an amount of espresso that‚Äôs almost never consistent. it also varies in how extremely burnt it often tastes but i‚Äôd rather drink it burnt than as 32oz cup of milk. and there‚Äôs also actually a pretty alarming frequency to having a caffeinated drink show up despite ordering decaf, as well. 

what‚Äôs the process to make that exact drink? are the employees doing something wrong or is it some kind of machine that‚Äôs wildly inconsistent/unreliable? i generally don‚Äôt complain about it and just drink what i get (unless they give me caffeinated, i strictly can‚Äôt have that) but i‚Äôd still really like to understand what‚Äôs going on.

here‚Äôs an example of something that happened earlier during my shift. there was a lady who apparently ordered a large coffee with 4 cream, 2 sugar and caramel swirl and i missed the caramel part because she was talking on the phone at the same time. i even asked her right before she paid to confirm her order. i said ‚Äú4 cream, 2 sugar.‚Äù and she just nodded and kept talking on the phone so i told her the total and she paid. a couple mins later we got her the coffee and she tells us that she needed caramel. i missed it. because she was on the phone and barely paid attention.

look im sorry for being or sounding selfish. but when you‚Äôre ordering. please give us your full attention. it takes a couple seconds to a few mins at most to order, depending how much you order of course. im not asking for the moon here. i just need to be able to take everyone‚Äôs orders correctly so we don‚Äôt have issues or complaints later on about their order not correct because of a miscommunication. so give your full attention to dunkin‚Äô employees for the few mins you‚Äôre ordering. then when you‚Äôre done, do whatever you want. trust me it‚Äôll make things easier for all of us.",a request from a dunkin‚Äô employee

2344,DunkinDonuts,"i've worked at dunkin for a few weeks now and i've had more than one person order an iced latte with cream substituting the milk. now for those who don't know, a iced latte is made with ice, whatever flavor you want, a shot of espresso, and milk/milk substitute. this one lady came in and ordered with cream instead of milk, and when i made the drink and she looked at the very light drink (cream makes any drink much lighter) and said ""why is there so little coffee, they always have more coffee."" now you aren't supposed to give more espresso without charging extra but im not a very confrontational guy so i took the drink and put in another shot, mixed it, and handed it back. the lady took one look at the drink, picked it up, shook her head, and turned away. i tried telling her that the cream is gonna make it always look much lighter, but she huffed towards the front of the store, lifted up the drink, and with a dunk that would put michael jordan to shame, dunked it in the trash and walked out the door.

i talked with my coworkers and manager about this (it shook me up quite a bit since i try really hard not to mess things up) and we all agreed that she was being very unreasonable. 

i just hope whoever reads this and did not know how light cream makes espresso drinks to be understanding to the workers behind the counter, and if you want a darker drink to maybe consider adding more espresso or a flavor swirl.

2349,DunkinDonuts,"it was the 1980s or 90s  when dd had a 'twist' donut that i don't see anywhere anymore.  it was 'cake' type donut with a two part twist, coved in a glaze that would flake off.  fairly dark in color.  maybe a 'maple' derived glaze???  i haven't seen them for years.

not a french cruller, not a glazed twist or a cinnamon twist- more 'cakey', not an 'old fashioned'- but that is getting closer to the density.  not a maple bar.  not a sour cream- but that's getting to the doughiness.  

i could have sworn that after they pulled the donut itself, that there were munchkin donuts with the basic recipe.

they were pretty ugly.  almost like the space rock from 2 years ago, not neat twist .

2351,DunkinDonuts,"i'm an employee and i just need to rant. this new hire ruined my morning. we are already at a location where our equipment is faulty; tickets stop being printed constantly, our register system goes down multiple times a day, someone is always there fixing the oasis machines, etc. it's already chaotic even with competent employees especially during the 8-11 rush. we're also at a location with a ton of foot traffic so we get yelled at by customers multiple times a day even when we didn't do anything wrong and shit like this just gives customers more of an excuse to treat us like garbage. 

we have a new hire who is truly and legitimately terrible. i understand that training can take a while and no one is perfect at first, but she is loud and obnoxious; complicates the tickets by fucking the orders up so someone else has to remake them, not bumping, not making them in order, etc; she hands orders to the wrong customers, and she even refuses to learn how to make certain things. no other new hire i have met has had this much difficulty learning what to do, and none of them have had a bad attitude like this. most of them have at least the drinks and the order system down pat by their second day and do their best to listen to their coworkers.

today she wouldn't even follow the directions posted on the machine when we asked her to make a fucking coolatta, possibly the easiest drink to make at dunkin', during a huge rush. she actually argued with us about it because we kept telling her the tickets need to be made in the order that they arrived. put x pumps of syrup into the blender cup, stick it in the machine, press 3 buttons. the directions are right fucking there. jesus. yet she tries to perform other tasks that she doesn't know how to do yet without asking, so today as a result 3 coffee machines were not working for 10 mins during the biggest rush of the day because she didn't even put the fucking filter or coffee in there before pressing brew and did not ask for help. she is also constantly in the way wiping the counters down or asking everyone stupid questions when we have literally 20 customers standing around waiting for their coffee/food. when i say stupid questions, i mean she goes back into the kitchen to ask them where the food is when they are clearly hustling as fast as they can to get the orders out, they have worked at dd for way longer than her, and she doesn't even know how to make hash browns. she is constantly eating and drinking in front of the customers, and i watched her over-20 yr old ass squirt whipped cream into a half full cup of coffee multiple times and drink it in front of the customers. all while our regional manager was there. she fucked up so many times that the entire morning was a complete disaster, and yes, it was honestly mostly her fault. not to mention some of her behavior was just plain obnoxious. i am not trying to be unfair here, it just really messed up my whole day because my shift was 100% more stressful than usual. i hope our manager notices and fires her, honestly.",new hire is terrible and complicates the entire system

2363,DunkinDonuts,"hello! i'm actually a former dunkin' employee, i quit a little over a week ago. i'd been having some issues for a while with the way my manager was running our store when it comes to safety and a lot of hypocrisy in his actions, which i'll get into now. some of my issues with said manager include:

* *glove wearing*: when making anything at our sandwich station, my manager only uses one glove and *reuses* this singular glove over and over for as long as he can until it's seriously worn out or too greasy to a point where it would be noticeable on customers' food. he enforces glove reusing for everyone at the store. this is obviously a safety/health hazard which i had brought up multiple times, and since he knew that i used *two* gloves and changed gloves between tasks which is protocol, he always did everything in his power to make sure that i was never on sandwich station, even if everyone else on the floor was busy and food needed to be made. super upsetting how much he valued saving a few cents for gloves over the health and safety of customers.
* *covid shitshow:* my manager is a complete hypocrite when it comes to covid. he claims to care about covid and the risks associated with it, however, he and my coworkers *never* wear their masks properly. no social distancing is enforced whatsoever. he always invites random friends or family back behind the counter who also *do not* wear masks or social distance, which made me feel extremely uncomfortable. in addition, a lot of customers who come into our store often are not wearing any type of face covering and do not distance themselves from other customers, which he doesn't care about. i was required to serve people who didn't follow the rules. however, our bathroom is closed and has been closed for as long as i had worked there, which he continuously lied to customers about, saying that it is ""due to covid"" when in reality he's simply too lazy to have anyone clean it. i got in trouble for even letting people who were having emergencies/pregnant women, etc. use the bathroom. i actually got covid around new years, and after my initial positive test, my doctor advised that i do not get tested again, and that i should just complete the required quarantine and return to work if i was asymptomatic--since according to them, covid tests could still show up positive up to 90 days after an initial positive test even if you are actually negative. (i am a minor btw)--my manager made me get another test, of course, because of ""the risk"".
* *lack of transparency and consistency*: i'm not sure if this is common (hopefully not), but there was a severe lack of honesty/transparency and consistency when it came to drinks at my store. if we did not have any decaf brewed and someone ordered it, my manager would instruct us to just serve people original blend instead. i recognize that this could seriously harm people if they might be sensitive to caffeine, have health issues, etc.. so i would always make small batches of decaf anyway and get in trouble for it?? huh???? yeah, i'm definitely the one in the wrong for valuing customer's health and giving them what they paid for. dickhead. anyway, aside from this, cups would consistently, purposely not be filled to the top, and when we were nearly out of a swirl/shot/addition, he'd simply eyeball in order to avoid wasting even one single drop. talk about cheap?? customers would end up with barely any of what they ordered, or way too much.
* *reusing cups/wraps/bags:* if someone made an order wrong or someone never picked up an order or something like this, my manager enforced that cups be reused along with bags and sandwich wraps etc. this can be a serious issue if a customer might have allergies, and it's also just plain gross? who the fuck wants to be served someone else's used cup or crumpled wrap? again, the pattern of wanting so desperately to save a few cents over health and consistency.
* *got mad at me for how clean i kept things behind the counter:* what...?
* *communication:* never put orders into the register to print out labels correctly, valuing speed over precision/accuracy. this led to orders being made wrong and things being sent back, backing us up even more which was just horrid if we were busy. also got mad if i asked for clarification, since he often put things into the register without the customer even finishing what they were saying.
* *scheduling me for unapproved hours and getting mad when i couldn't stay longer with a snap of his fingers, even though i'm literally a 16 year old minor:* self explanatory.
* *generally being annoying and rude as fuck:* since my manager knew that i would *actually* follow protocol and not go along with the bullshit penny-pinching hazardous rules he made up, he would constantly make sure that he was on the floor and always practically breathing down my neck during my shifts whether i was on register or fulfilling orders, which was extremely irritating. i'm perfectly capable of doing everything my position entails, but he apparently thought i needed extra observation for being such a rebellious worker!!

sorry that this is super long, this post sort of doubles as a rant for me. really needed to get all this off my chest. i actually recently got hired at starbucks! super excited to get started there--but that's a bit of a tangent. the main point of this post is: does anyone have any idea how i could possibly hold my manager accountable for all of his shitty actions and behaviors--like somewhere to file a report or something similar? this list doesn't even encapsulate *all* the shitty things he does as a business owner. he is putting people in danger on the daily, and *someone* needs to finally stand up to him and try to put these things to a stop. i'm hoping it'll be me, even as a former employee.",advice on holding manager accountable?

2381,DunkinDonuts,"i ordered on the app, just got a coffee and selected drive through pickup. i arrived at the dunkin in my town at 730, i wait in line behind about 6 cars or so. 20 minutes go by and only two cars have moved. maybe they're understaffed, maybe its a difficult customer. whatever all i know is i have to be at work in 10 minutes and cannot wait any longer.  i leave the drive through line and go to work. hopeful to just find a simple way to do it on the app. unfortunately i cannot do this, emailed, called, and in the app it says once its placed and charged it cannot be refunded.  


so if say the location had to close, and you already paid. you cannot receive your money or your order. if they are out of what you order its up to the store management to allow you to substitute it. if you get into a accident on the way, you cannot get a refund. every other business that has ordering ahead will refund your money if you do not get the product. if you prepay for a pizza delivery and never get it. (car breakdown, staff walkout, ran out of stock ect) you have a easy option to get your money back. so really there is more of a decentive than advantage to using the app. since often ordering at the drive through is the same wait time, and if the line doesn't move you are out of your money. the only advantage is the rewards.  
im disputing the charge on my card, maybe im a karen. probably but im really upset that they expect me to pay the same price for a drink ahead, all whilst selling my data.

2427,DunkinDonuts,"these things are so damn good, i was buying them a couple times a day. but at $5+ for a large (and, like most restaurants and shops, it's 99% ice when you order it), i decided i needed to make them at home, too to save a bit. i was unable to really find a recipe online, so i just asked them how they're made when i was in the store one time last month.

basically, you just need the sweetened matcha powder (i buy the [jade leaf organic latte mix on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/b089q9xd2t/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=utf8&amp;psc=1)) and your choice of milk. having messed with the mix a bunch, i've found that the closest i've gotten is 2 1/2 scoops of the powdered mix, blended with 32oz of whole milk. obviously dunks would use a different sweetened blend, but in my own personal taste test, this is almost perfect.

2484,DunkinDonuts,"the dunkin‚Äô stores in my area only have sweetened and extra creamy. it‚Äôs unfortunate because unsweetened almond milk is so much healthier/fewer calories, as is regular unsweetened oat milk. i also don‚Äôt have much of a sweet tooth, so it tastes better as well.

it‚Äôs difficult to find a way to drink an iced macchiato without it being like drinking a meal, i guess is what i‚Äôm getting at. i can‚Äôt have lactose, so my only choices are almond and oat. i love the taste of the oat milk (much more than the almond) and i only ever get unsweetened flavor shots, but as far as i know it‚Äôs a lot of this sweet and/or creamy milk in the drinks that‚Äôs the worst part in terms of nutrition.

is this a universal thing at dunkin‚Äô or store specific? anyone else have anything besides those options? we only have the almond, oat, and whole or skim milk in my area. no soy or any other substitutes.

2516,DunkinDonuts,"i can't sleep, so i'm making an in-depth guide to ordering at dunkin. i'm probably missing some things, but this is already a massive undertaking.

now, i'm not the one to say that dunkin never fucks up. having worked there, i've messed up a few orders, misheard people, etc. listen, we're overworked and underpaid. depending on the location, we are moving nonstop for 6-9 hours every day. things tend to blend together. we have a routine.

here's a few tips on getting your order correct (almost) every time in the most efficient way possible.

1. **2-3-4-5** 

most dunkin regulars know this one. if you want a regular amount of cream and a regular amount of sugar, you will get 2 for both cream and sugar on a small, 3 for a medium, 4 for a large, and 5 for an x-large.

instead of saying *""one large hot coffee with cream and sugar.""*, say *""one large hot coffee with 4 cream and 4 sugar.""* some new or bonehead employees will just click the cream and sugar button once, but specifying the specific amount of each will not leave your order up for interpretation.

2. ""**light and sweet"" vs ""light \_\_\_""**

if you like your coffee extra light (creamy) and sweet, dunkin is adding +1 of both cream and sugar to your drink. saying ""small black coffee, sweet"", might get you 1, 2, or 3 sugars, depending on the employee. saying ""extra cream and sugar"" should always yield you +1 cream and +1 sugar added to the normal regular amount.

if you want your coffee sweet, or light (with dairy), stick with the 2-3-4-5 number rule while ordering.

if you want your coffee with light (a small amount of) sugar, just think of the size, corresponding number, and -1. 

instead of saying *""one small hot coffee, light cream""*, say *""one small hot coffee, 1 cream"".*

3. **swirls are sweetened, shots are not.**

french vanilla, caramel, mocha and hazelnut are the year round swirl flavors at every dunkin. the swirls are thick, sweetened syrup. each 1 pump of swirl is as sweet as 1 sugar.

sugar free vanilla, hazelnut, blueberry, raspberry, toasted almond and coconut (at most locations) are the year round shot flavors. the shots are liquidy, sugar free flavorings. if you order a flavor shot, and don't order additional sugar to it, your drink will not be sweet.

note: hazelnut and vanilla come in both swirl and shot. to differentiate if you want your flavoring sweet or not, just specify if you want the shot or swirl.

instead of saying *""one medium vanilla iced coffee""*, say *""one medium iced coffee with 3 vanilla shots""*. if you really want to get the point across, you can say *""one medium iced coffee with 3 vanilla shots, unsweetened""*.

4. **avoid words/phrases that are up for interpretation**

*""large hot coffee with a lot of sugar""* how much is a lot to you? *""large coffee with a little bit of sugar""* how much is a little to you? *""large coffee with some sugar""* some as in a little or a regular amount? *""large hot coffee""* with what in it? *""large iced decaf""* decaf iced tea or iced coffee? 

we can't read your mind.  


5. **put your order in optimal sequence** (you don't have to do this)

if you wanna really help us out, you can sequence your order in the way in which the employee hits the buttons.  
size  
temperature  
blend  
number of creams  
number of sugars  
number of swirls/shots

*""one medium hot explorer blend with 2 creams and 5 sugars and 4 blueberry shots""*

6. **take an extra second to check the sticker before leaving**

the sticker tells you exactly how the order was made and put in the system. if you want a regular amount of cream and sugar, your ticket will say ""reg crm&amp;sug"" if you ordered light and sweet or extra cream and extra sugar, your ticket will say ""extra crm&amp;sug"" if you ordered a non-regular amount of cream or sugar, or just one or the other, there will be a number next to the addition. ""3 sugar""

the number next to the swirls and shots normally indicates how many pumps are in it. this is different at literally every dunkin. but officially, if you ordered a regular amount of caramel swirl, your ticket will say ""carml swrl"" or ""# carml swrl"". if you ordered a non-regular amount of caramel swirl, your ticket will say ""carml swrl # less/extra swrl"" or ""# carml swirl""  


if i missed any essential ordering tips, let me know and i'll edit it throughout tomorrow.

  
**general tips.**

1. turn off your music in your car! 
2. get off the phone
3. if your engine is loud, turn it off
4. have your payment prepared before you get to the window.
5. don't talk through your mask at the speaker
6. please don't scream at the speaker
7. roll your window all the way down, talk in the direction of the speaker
8. many dunkins do not get more donuts throughout the day. some re-up. some make them themselves.
9. many dunkins do not make any of their baked goods in-house. some do a few, some do it all.
10. if you don't like how the sugar in the iced coffee always settles at the bottom, ask for liquid sugar instead.
11. if you order a donut on the app, it does not tell us which donut you ordered. it just says ""donut"". we will have to ask you which donut you got once you get to the window.
12. the app also does not know which donuts we have left or if we've run out of items.
13. often, we will have seasonal swirls before and after their release and end dates. just ask.
14. if you hear the latte steamer through the speaker, speak louder because that thing is deafening. 
15. dairy products (such as cream, milk, and skim) come out of a dispensing machine as 1-5 tablespoons. oat and almond milk is eyeballed and estimated.
16. most of the time, employees will shake/swirl drinks instead of stirring them with a spoon for time efficiency. if you're picky about the distribution of your sugar/swirls, ask them to stir it with a spoon when you order.
17. some locations don't have an automatic sugar dispenser, instead they have a teaspoon and a bowl of sugar. each employee spoons their sugar differently, so it may vary. 
18. we don't have a microwave, just a speed-oven
19. if you ask for less ice in a latte, you're getting more milk. never more espresso.
20. lattes have one shot of espresso and are stirred. macchiatos have a double shot and are not stirred.
21. iced cappuccinos aren't foamed in a steamer. they're blended using the oasis machine.
22. cappuccinos have overall less milk than lattes and macchs. it will be very light weight-wise.
23. we can't steam cream.
24. if you order on the app, some franchises will make it right away before you get to the drive thu, some shops will wait to make it until you get there.
25. swirls contain dairy in the syrup!
26. lattes already contain mostly milk. you don't have to order it with ""cream and sugar"".
27. lattes, macchs, and capps do not come sweet unless you add sugar or swirls to them.
28. signature lattes are the same as regular lattes with swirl, but they have whipped cream and toppings on them. it's cheaper to order a flavored latte and pay for extra whip.
29. oat/almond milk is an upcharge.
30. sometimes we premake espresso shots and they'll sit for some time before being used in a drink.
31. matcha powder contains a shocking amount of lead. don't drink it every day.
32. not all locations have cold brews and cold coffees on the taps system.

for those saying it's just red french vanilla swirl, how? to me, it tastes like strawberries and cream/strawberry milk i used to drink as a kid. i don't normally care for the french vanilla swirl so i'd be impressed if it actually was.

i went in this morning to pick up a mobile order and it wasn‚Äôt ready yet so while i was waiting i just watched what was going on and everyone looked so scared and run down and then i realized there was a new-ish (i‚Äôm assuming fairly new) person training and the manager or shift lead was being so mean to them!!! nothing they did was good enough and he kept treating him like he was doing something wrong. at one point a man came in and ordered ‚Äúa nitro‚Äù and the new employee who was on the register asked what size. the manager snapped on him and told him to move and that he would handle the orders. little things like this just kept happening where clearly the new employee was trying to learn and asking logical questions and the manager clearly had no patience. it just made me so upset and i can‚Äôt get over it! it was pretty clear this manager just did not appreciate his team at all because the atmosphere in the store was so tense, even i was scared of this guy!!!

by no means am i sensitive to sweetness either, i have a fair share of a sweet tooth, probably more than i'd like, but even a pump extra than the typical (2 small-3 medium-4 large) feels excessively sweet to me.

so i couldn‚Äôt help but laugh earlier when my manager was taking orders, explained that to a customer, so the customer was like... okay, so i‚Äôd like to get an extra charged coffee, and also in a separate cup can i get a double espresso? manager kinda just rolled their eyes and still rang it up, though i made it a point to fill the cup all the way up with coffee so at the very least she‚Äôd have to drink some before adding the espresso.

2608,DunkinDonuts,"not sure if anyone else has been following this drama (i haven't really seen anything about it here), but it seems like the age of the dunkin' app has finally come to a close for android &lt;7 users.

2618,DunkinDonuts,so i'm pretty sure i'm in the absolute minority here but i am obsessed with the sugarplum swirl. some of my local stores still have it but idk when it actually ends (i thought it ended already) i've seen on posts here that some stores will sell the syrup and swirls... none of the ones i've been to will. i've begged. i've tried doing a starbucks hack and asking for 50 pumps in a cup of ice no ice to redeem the free drink lol but obv the app wont do that and neither will any of the employees - like literally everyone here is stingy af - one store wanted to charge like 35 cents a pump over the standard (3or4) even when the app gives up to 10. not to mention i can't even access sugarplum on the app anymore so i have to ask everywhere i go. i digress. i need this sugarplum in my life so i'm coming to you guys to ask if you have any hacks or suggestions on how/where to get it other than spending $60 on ebay because that's absurd. i'm in central florida.,sugarplum dreams...

when i actually looked at my cup, i realized the label with my order had been meticulously placed (seemingly intentional) over another order label. i thought that‚Äôs a bit weird, giving me a drink that was obviously intended for another customer that was mistakenly made or whatever. but then i really thought about it and realized how ballsy (and dangerous?) of them to do this because god forbid someone is allergic to certain milks/ingredients.

but here's my question, i know inside they have a tip jar for cash but i usually use the drive-thru and there's no tip jar there, as well as no way to add a tip with my card.  is there a way to tip through the app or is dunkin just not a huge tipping establishment? i've been doing the survey whenever i get my receipt and try to make a note of the employees name if i see it to make it a bit more personal but i wasn't sure if there was a different way i could be tipping them?

also, side note, is there a benefit to paying through the app? i usually just scan through the app and pay with my credit card separately.

i just had my interview today and i‚Äôm pretty sure i‚Äôll be hired. as a teenager still in school i just have one question regarding if dunkin‚Äô donuts has lockers to store items in. i had told them my availability and i‚Äôd be coming from school but i forgot to ask if there would be a place to store things like backpacks and coats.
